# Welcome to the Open Science Initiative

The **Open Science Initiative (OSI)** is Meta's commitment to advancing egocentric AI research through open collaboration. We provide researchers with access to cutting-edge tools, datasets, and machine learning models built on data from Aria glasses. OSI enables you to analyze, visualize, and build upon rich multimodal egocentric data without needing your own Aria device.

## What is OSI?

OSI makes egocentric AI research accessible by open-sourcing three key components:

### 📊 Public Datasets
High-quality, multimodal egocentric datasets collected with Aria glasses, featuring:
- **Raw sensor streams** from multiple synchronized cameras, IMUs, audio, and more
- **On-device machine perception** outputs (VIO, eye gaze, hand tracking)
- **Offline machine perception annotations** from cloud-based processing
- **Rich semantic annotations** from state-of-the-art perception algorithms

Our datasets capture real-world scenarios with time-synchronized multi-participant recordings, enabling research in computer vision, multimodal learning, robotics, and contextual AI.

### 🛠️ `projectaria-tools`
A comprehensive Python/C++ library for working with Aria data:
- Load and visualize VRS (Video Recording Storage) files
- Access device calibration and sensor data
- Work with machine perception outputs (VIO, eye gaze, hand tracking)
- Process and analyze multimodal sensor streams
- Export data to standard formats

### 🤖 Open Models
Pre-trained machine learning models and algorithms for egocentric perception:
