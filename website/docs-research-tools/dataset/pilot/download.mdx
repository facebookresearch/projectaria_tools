This page provides instructions for previewing, downloading, and installing the tools needed to work with the Aria Gen 2 Pilot Dataset.

## Preview the Dataset

Before downloading, you can explore the dataset using our interactive Dataset Explorer:

**ðŸ”— [Dataset Explorer: https://explorer.projectaria.com/gen2pilot](https://explorer.projectaria.com/gen2pilot)**

### What You Can Preview

The Dataset Explorer provides:

- **MP4 Video Previews**: Watch video clips from RGB camera stream
- **Interactive 3D Visualization**: Explore 30-second segments with [Rerun](https://rerun.io/) visualization showing:
  - Raw sensor data from all cameras
  - On-device machine perception outputs (VIO, eye gaze, hand tracking)
  - MPS results (3D trajectories, semi-dense point clouds)
  - Additional algorithm outputs (ASR, heart rate, depth, etc.)

This allows you to understand the data structure and quality before downloading the full dataset.

## Download the Dataset

### Via Dataset Explorer (Recommended)

1. Visit [https://explorer.projectaria.com/gen2pilot](https://explorer.projectaria.com/gen2pilot)
2. Browse the available sequences
3. Follow the download instructions provided on the explorer page
4. Accept the license agreement and terms of use

The Dataset Explorer provides detailed instructions for downloading individual sequences or the entire dataset.

### Dataset Size

The complete Aria Gen 2 Pilot Dataset includes:
- 12 sequences (4 participants per sequence)
- Raw VRS files with all sensor streams
- On-device machine perception outputs
- Offline MPS results
- Additional perception algorithm outputs (ASR, heart rate, depth, etc.)

Please ensure you have sufficient storage space before downloading.

## Install the Dataset Tools

To work with the Aria Gen 2 Pilot Dataset, install the `projectaria-gen2-pilot-dataset` Python package.

### System Requirements

- **Python**: 3.8 - 3.12 (Python 3.12 recommended)
- **Operating Systems**:
  - Linux (x64): Fedora 40/41, Ubuntu 20.04/22.04 LTS
  - macOS (ARM64): macOS 14+ (Apple Silicon)
  - macOS (Intel): macOS 13+

### Installation Steps

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="unix" label="Linux & macOS">

```bash
# Deactivate conda if active
conda deactivate

# Remove existing environment if it exists
rm -rf ~/projectaria_gen2_python_env

# Create new Python virtual environment
python3.12 -m venv ~/projectaria_gen2_python_env

# Activate the environment
source ~/projectaria_gen2_python_env/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

# Install the package with all dependencies
python3 -m pip install 'projectaria-gen2-pilot-dataset[all]'
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### What Gets Installed

The `projectaria-gen2-pilot-dataset[all]` package includes:

- **Core data loaders**: Access VRS files, MPS outputs, and algorithm results
- **Visualization tools**: Rerun integration for 3D visualization
- **All dependencies**: Including `projectaria-tools` for working with Aria data
- **Tutorial notebooks**: Example code for loading and analyzing the dataset

### Verify Installation

After installation, verify it works by checking the package version:

```bash
python3 -c "import projectaria_gen2_pilot_dataset"
```
