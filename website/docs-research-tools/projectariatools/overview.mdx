# Project Aria Tools

`projectaria-tools` is the official library for accessing and processing data recorded by **Project Aria glasses**.
It provides a unified interface to load VRS files and access all associated sensor and machine perception data through high-level, easy-to-use APIs.
The library supports efficient operations such as random access, timestamp-based queries, and synchronized multi-sensor data retrieval, with a consistent set of **C++ and Python APIs** seamlessly bridged via Pybind11.

Project Aria glasses record its data in **VRS** (Visual Recordings System) format, which is a general-purpose recording format from Meta.
Properly interpreting Project Aria VRS requires detailed understanding of the device’s sensor configurations, calibration models, and on-device perception outputs.
`projectaria-tools` abstracts these complexities, ensuring that all data is correctly parsed, aligned, and represented for research and development workflows.

In addition to data access, the library includes visualization and conversion utilities that allow users to inspect and export selected streams to standard formats such as CSV and MP4, making it easier to analyze and share Aria data across diverse toolchains.
