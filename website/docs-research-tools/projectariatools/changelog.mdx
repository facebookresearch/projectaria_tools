## Version 2.0.0

🚀 **Major Version Release**

We're excited to announce a major update of the library — now supporting both Aria Gen1 and Gen2 VRS data with the same C++ and Python APIs you already know. This release also introduces full access to On-Device Machine Perception (MP) data in Aria Gen2 VRS.

### API & Data Compatibility

- **Unified Interface**: The C++ and Python APIs remain unchanged — your existing Gen1 code continues to work seamlessly
- **Extended Capabilities**: Added APIs to access On-Device Machine Perception data streams available in Gen2 recordings
- **Cross-Generation Support**: A single codebase now handles Gen1 and Gen2 VRS data without modification

### New & Enhanced Tools

#### New Tools

- **`aria_rerun_viewer`**: A Python-based visualizer for Aria VRS files, built on Rerun for interactive multi-modal exploration
- **`gen2_mp_csv_exporter`**: A Python tool to export On-Device MP data from VRS to CSV, fully compatible with the Machine Perception Service (MPS) format

#### Upgraded Tools

- **`vrs_health_check`**: Completely re-engineered and released as a standalone Python package for easier installation & use

### Documentation

- **New Python Tutorials**: Our Python tutorials have been completely rewritten into seven focused guides, covering topics such as:
  - Queued multi-sensor data
  - Device calibration usage
  - Multi-device time alignment
  - ...and more
- **Updated Documentation Websites**: We now maintain dedicated documentation portals for each generation:
  - Aria Gen2 Documentation Website — new APIs, tools, and data formats
  - Aria Gen1 Documentation Website — original docs for Gen1 workflows
