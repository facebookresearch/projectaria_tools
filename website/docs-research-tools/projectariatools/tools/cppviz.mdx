# C++ Visualization Tools

This page covers the C++ visualization tools available in Project Aria Tools. These tools provide native performance visualization of Aria data using the Pangolin framework.

## Prerequisites

To use the C++ visualization tools, you need to build them from source using CMake. These tools are not included in the standard Python package installation.

**Required build step**: Follow the "build using CMake from source code" instructions in the [Advanced Installation](/docs-research-tools/projectariatools/advanced-installation.mdx) guide to compile the C++ visualization tools.

The C++ tools require the Pangolin library for visualization. If Pangolin is not found during compilation, the visualization tools will not be built.

## `aria_viewer`

The `aria_viewer` is a C++ binary that provides real-time visualization of Aria VRS (Video Recording and Sensor) data using the Pangolin framework. It offers native performance for visualizing multi-modal sensor data from Aria devices.

/>

### Basic Usage

```bash
aria_viewer --vrs path/to/your/file.vrs
```

### Command Line Options

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `--vrs` | string | Yes | Path to the VRS file you want to visualize |

### What You'll See

The C++ viewer provides an interactive visualization environment with multiple components:

- **RGB & SLAM Camera Streams**: Real-time display of RGB and SLAM camera images with overlaid eye gaze and hand tracking results
- **1D Sensor Data**: Time series plots of:
  - **IMU signals** (accelerometer and gyroscope data)
  - **Audio signals** (microphone waveforms)
  - **Barometer signals** (pressure and temperature readings)
- **3D Visualization**: Interactive 3D scene showing:
  - **VIO trajectory** (Visual-Inertial Odometry path)
  - **Eye gaze vectors** in 3D space
  - **Hand tracking** results and poses
  - **Device pose** and orientation

### Interactive Controls

The viewer includes real-time controls for:
- **Play/Pause**: Start and stop data playback
- **Speed Control**: Adjust playback speed using a slider
- **Timestamp Navigation**: Jump to specific timestamps by dragging the timestamp slider
- **Stream Toggles**: Enable/disable individual data streams for focused analysis
- **3D Camera Controls**: Navigate and explore the 3D visualization

### Known Issues and Workarounds

**High-frequency sequence playback issue**: There is a known issue when playing high-frequency Aria-Gen2 data at real speed, where camera views may update asynchronously. This is due to CPU-based image decoding speed limitations.

**Workarounds**:
1. **Use Python viewer**: Fall back to the `aria_rerun_viewer` for smooth high-frequency playback
2. **Reduce playback speed**: Use the speed control slider to play at slower speeds
3. **Random access**: Dragging the timestamp slider for random access always works correctly

The development team is actively working on a solution for this issue.
