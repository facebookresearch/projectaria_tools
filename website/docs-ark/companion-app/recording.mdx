2. Select **Custom recording**. The recording setup screen will appear. From here, you can name your recording, add notes, and select a recording profile.

6. Once you've finished recording, you can end the recording by tapping the **Complete recording** button in the app or by pressing the action button on your glasses. If you don't want to save your recording to the glasses, tap **Discard recording**.

You can view the health of the sensors you are recording with by tapping the **Data Integrity and Status** button during a recording.

### Consecutive recordings
Note that if you run multiple consecutive recordings, the app will automatically name them with a suffix of the number of recordings you've made. The number will automatically reset if you update the name field on a new recording.

## Manage recordings
Tap the **Recordings** tab in the bottom of your app (second from the left) to view recordings stored on your glasses.
