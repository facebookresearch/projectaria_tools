title: Time Domain Mapping for Multi-device Wireless Recordings/Streaming
---

Time Domain Mapping enables wireless time synchronization between multiple Aria glasses using sub-GHz radio frequencies. This feature allows recordings from different devices to be precisely aligned in post-processing.

## When to Use

- Recording with multiple Aria glasses simultaneously
- You need frame-accurate synchronization between devices
- Aligning multi-device data in post-processing pipelines

## Configuring Time Domain Mapping

1. Navigate to the **Recording** screen and tap **Advanced Options**.

2. Toggle **Time Domain Mapping** to enable the feature.

## Selecting a Mode

Choose one of the following modes based on your device's role:

| **Mode** | **Description** |
|---|---|
| Broadcaster | This device transmits timing signals. This sets the glasses as the primary/reference device. A unique Broadcaster ID is auto-generated. |
| Receiver | This device listens for timing signals from a Broadcaster (primary device). Use for secondary devices. |

## Configuring Channel and Broadcaster ID

1. Select a **Channel** from the dropdown. All devices in your recording session must use the same channel.
    1. **Broadcaster (primary)** device

    2. **Receiver (secondary)** device — choose the channel set on the **Broadcaster** device from the dropdown

2. Set the **Broadcaster ID**
    1. **Broadcaster (primary)** device: The Broadcaster ID is automatically generated and displayed on the Broadcaster device's screen.

    2. **Receiver (secondary)** device: Enter the Broadcaster ID exactly as shown on the device set as Broadcaster. This allows the Receiver device to tune into the correct signal for synchronizing with the Broadcaster.

## Starting a Synchronized Recording

**Important:** The **Broadcaster (primary) device MUST start recording first** before any Receiver (secondary) devices begin recording.

1. Configure all devices with matching **Channel** and **Broadcaster ID** settings.
    1. Refer to steps above in *Configuring Channel and Broadcaster ID*
    2. Confirm that **Time Domain Mapping** shows up in the "what's recorded" section of the "New Recording" screen

2. Tap **Begin new recording** on each device.
    1. Start with the Broadcaster (primary) device first
3. Receiver devices will automatically sync to the Broadcaster's timing signals.
