# Bluetooth Audio Pairing

## Overview

Bluetooth Audio Pairing allows your Aria Gen 2 glasses to function as a Bluetooth audio device for your phone. You gain access to audio playback and media streaming through the glasses' built-in speakers and microphones.

## Pairing Bluetooth Audio

Bluetooth Audio Pairing is offered in the initial setup flow when connecting to your glasses for the first time.

1. After naming your device, the Bluetooth Audio Pairing screen will appear.

   - Tap **Cancel** if you want to set up later. Pairing can be done from the Dashboard or Device Details screen.

3. Tap **Continue** to start the pairing process.
   - Follow the platform-specific instructions that are shown in the setup screen, then return to the Aria app once you have connected to your glasses from your phone's native Bluetooth manager screen.

If pairing was skipped during setup, you can initiate pairing from device settings:

1. **Navigate** to the Device Details screen.
2. Scroll down to the Bluetooth Audio section.

**Note:** There is a 30 second window from the time of initiating the pairing from the modal before the glasses will become undiscoverable. If this happens, return to the Aria app and start over.
