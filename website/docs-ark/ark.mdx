# Welcome to Aria Research Kit

Aria Research Kit (ARK) is a comprehensive development platform for the **Aria Gen 2 glasses**, designed to empower researchers and developers to build cutting-edge applications in egocentric AI, contextual AI, robotics, spatial computing, and human-computer interaction. ARK provides everything you need to capture, process, and analyze data from Aria's advanced sensor suite.

## What is Aria Gen 2?

Aria Gen 2 is a state-of-the-art research device featuring an advanced sensor suite that includes:

- **Four computer vision (CV) cameras** with wide field of view and HDR imaging
- **RGB point-of-view (POV) camera** for high-resolution egocentric vision
- **On-device VIO** for real-time 3D tracking and mapping
- **On-device Eye tracking system** for precise gaze estimation and attention modeling
- **On-device 21-keypoint hand tracking** for articulated hand pose estimation
- **Spatial and contact microphones** for high-fidelity audio capture
- **IMU, barometer, magnetometer, and GNSS** for accurate localization and motion tracking
- **Ambient Light Sensor (ALS) with UV channel** for indoor/outdoor context awareness
- **PPG sensor** for heart rate monitoring

See [Hardware Specifications](/technical-specs/device/hardware) for more details.

## What You Can Do with ARK

### üéÆ Control Your Device
Use the **Client SDK** to programmatically control Aria Gen 2 devices:
- Start and stop recordings
- Stream sensor data in real-time
- Access on-device machine perception outputs (VIO, hand tracking, eye gaze)
- Configure recording profiles for different research applications
- Automate device workflows with Python scripts or CLI tools

### üì± Mobile Companion App
Pair your device with the **Companion App** to:
- Configure and manage your Aria Gen 2 glasses
- Start recordings with a simple interface
- Monitor device status and battery life
- Manage recordings from your phone

### üîç On-Device Machine Perception
Run real-time algorithms directly on Aria Gen 2:
- **Visual Inertial Odometry (VIO)** at 10Hz (and 800Hz high-frequency output)
- **Eye gaze tracking** at up to 90Hz with pupil diameter and vergence depth
- **Hand tracking** at 30Hz with 21 joint landmarks per hand

### üß† Machine Perception Services (MPS)
Leverage cloud-based processing to generate rich outputs from your recordings:
- 3D trajectory and semi-dense point cloud
- Hand tracking

All optimized for all-day wearability with energy-efficient hardware acceleration.

### üõ†Ô∏è Data Analysis & Visualization
Use the comprehensive toolset to:
- Validate recording quality with VRS Health Check
- Visualize sensor data streams
- Export data in standard formats
- Build custom analysis pipelines

## Getting Started

Choose your path based on your role and objectives:

### For Developers
Start with the [Client SDK](/ark/client-sdk/start) to control your device programmatically. Install the Python SDK, authenticate your device, and begin streaming or recording data within minutes.

### For Researchers
Explore the [Device Manual](/ark/device/manual) to understand the hardware capabilities and sensor specifications. Learn about recording profiles and on-device machine perception in the [On-Device Machine Perception](/ark/on_device_mp) guide.

### For First-Time Users
Begin with the [Companion App](/ark/companion-app/start) for a simple way to set up and use your Aria Gen 2 glasses. Then explore the Client SDK when you're ready for more advanced control.

### For Data Scientists
Check out [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/ark/mps/start) to learn how to process your recordings and generate rich perception signals for your research datasets.
