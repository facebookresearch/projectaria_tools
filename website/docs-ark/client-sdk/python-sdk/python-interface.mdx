# Python SDK Examples

The ClientSDK provides a comprehensive Python interface for programmatic control of your Aria Gen2 device. This page introduces the Python SDK and guides you through setting up the example code.

## Overview

The Python SDK enables you to:
* **Authenticate devices** programmatically with your PC
* **Establish connections** to devices via USB or wirelessly
* **Control recording** - Start, stop, and download recordings
* **Manage streaming** - Stream data with custom callbacks for real-time processing
* **Send commands** - Control device features like text-to-speech

---

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using the Python SDK, ensure you have:
* Installed the ClientSDK (see [Get Started](/ark/client-sdk/start) guide)
* Activated your virtual environment
* Your device connected and authenticated

### Export Example Code

The SDK includes example scripts that demonstrate common use cases. Extract them using:

```bash
# Export example codes
python -m aria.extract_sdk_samples --output ~/Downloads/
```

This creates a `projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2` directory containing all example scripts:

```bash
ls ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2

device_auth.py          # Authentication example
device_connect.py       # Connection example
device_record.py        # Recording example
device_streaming.py     # Streaming example
device_tts.py           # Text-to-speech example
```

## Available Examples

The following example pages provide detailed walkthroughs of each script:

### 1. [Authentication Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/auth-example)

Learn how to programmatically authenticate your device with your PC. This is the first step before using any device features.

**Topics covered:**
* Setting up DeviceClient
* Initiating authentication
* Handling authentication confirmation

---

### 2. [Connection Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/connection-example)

Understand how to establish a connection to a specific device using serial numbers or IP addresses.

**Topics covered:**
* Configuring device selection
* Establishing connections
* Handling connection errors

---

### 3. [Recording Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/recording-example)

Learn how to control recording operations, including starting, stopping, and downloading recordings.

**Topics covered:**
* Setting up recording configurations
* Managing recording sessions
* Downloading recordings to your local machine

---

### 4. [Streaming Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/streaming-example)

Explore real-time data streaming with custom callback functions for processing sensor data.

**Topics covered:**
* Configuring streaming profiles and interfaces
* Implementing data callbacks (image, audio, IMU, eye gaze, hand tracking, VIO)
* Recording streaming data to VRS files

---

### 5. [Text-to-Speech Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/text-to-speech-example)

Learn how to send text-to-speech commands to your device for audio feedback.

**Topics covered:**
* Sending TTS commands
* Controlling device audio output

---

## Common Python SDK Patterns

### Basic Device Connection Pattern

Most scripts follow this basic pattern:

```python
import aria.sdk_gen2 as sdk_gen2

# Create device client
device_client = sdk_gen2.DeviceClient()

# Configure client (optional - defaults to first available device)
config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()
config.device_serial = "1M0YDB5H7B0020"  # Optional: specify device
device_client.set_client_config(config)

# Connect to device
device = device_client.connect()
print(f"Connected to device: {device.connection_id()}")

# Use device for recording, streaming, etc.
```

---

### Error Handling Pattern

Always wrap device operations in try-except blocks:

```python
try:
    device = device_client.connect()
    print(f"Successfully connected to device {device.connection_id()}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect: {e}")
    return
```

---

### Configuration Pattern

Device operations (recording, streaming) typically require configuration:

```python
# Recording configuration
recording_config = sdk_gen2.RecordingConfig()
recording_config.profile_name = "profile8"
recording_config.recording_name = "my_recording"
device.set_recording_config(recording_config)

# Streaming configuration
streaming_config = sdk_gen2.HttpStreamingConfig()
streaming_config.profile_name = "mp_streaming_demo"
device.set_streaming_config(streaming_config)
```

---

## Next Steps

1. **Start with basics**: Begin with the [Authentication Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/auth-example)
2. **Progress through examples**: Work through each example in order
3. **Experiment**: Modify the examples to fit your use case
4. **Build custom applications**: Use the patterns to create your own scripts
