# Authentication Example

This example demonstrates how to programmatically authenticate your Aria Gen2 device with your PC using the Python SDK. Authentication is required before you can control the device or access its features.

## Quick Start

Run the authentication example script:

```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_auth.py
```

When prompted, open the Companion App on your mobile device and approve the authentication request.

---

## What This Example Does

The script performs the following steps:
1. Creates a device client to manage connections
2. Configures the client to connect to the first available device
3. Initiates the authentication process
4. Waits for user approval via the Companion App
5. Establishes a connection to verify authentication

---

## Code Walkthrough

### Step 1: Import Required Modules

```python
import time
import aria.sdk_gen2 as sdk_gen2
```

The `aria.sdk_gen2` module provides all the classes and functions needed to interact with Aria Gen2 devices.

---

### Step 2: Create Device Client

```python
device_client = sdk_gen2.DeviceClient()
```

The `DeviceClient` object manages authentication and device connections. It handles the communication between your PC and the device.

---

### Step 3: Configure the Client

```python
config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()
device_client.set_client_config(config)
```

**What this does:**
* Creates a default configuration that connects to the first available device
* If you want to connect to a specific device, you can set `config.device_serial` to the device's serial number

**Example with specific device:**
```python
config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()
config.device_serial = "1M0YDB5H7B0020"  # Replace with your device serial
device_client.set_client_config(config)
```

---

### Step 4: Initiate Authentication

```python
print("Authenticating device. Please open the Aria app and accept the pairing request")
device_client.authenticate()
time.sleep(5)
```

**What happens here:**
* The `authenticate()` method starts the authentication process
* The device sends a pairing request to the Companion App on your mobile device
* The script waits 5 seconds to give you time to approve the request

**Important:**
* Keep the Companion App open and in the foreground
* Check for a notification or prompt in the app
* Verify the hash code matches between your PC terminal and the Companion App
* Approve the authentication request

---

### Step 5: Connect and Verify

```python
try:
    device = device_client.connect()
    print(f"Device authentication successful to device {device.connection_id()}")
except Exception:
    print("Failed to authenticate and connect to device")
    return
```

**What this does:**
* Attempts to establish a connection to the authenticated device
* If successful, returns a `Device` object that you can use for recording, streaming, etc.
* The `device.connection_id()` provides the device identifier

---

## Complete Example Code

Here's the full authentication script:

```python
import time
import aria.sdk_gen2 as sdk_gen2


def device_auth():
    device_client = sdk_gen2.DeviceClient()
    config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()
    device_client.set_client_config(config)

    print(
        "Authenticating device. Please open the Aria app and accept the pairing request"
    )
    device_client.authenticate()
    time.sleep(5)

    try:
        device = device_client.connect()
        print(f"Device authentication successful to device {device.connection_id()}")
    except Exception:
        print(f"Failed to authenticate and connect to device")
        return


if __name__ == "__main__":
    device_auth()
```

---

## Expected Output

When running the script, you should see output similar to:

```
Authenticating device. Please open the Aria app and accept the pairing request
[AriaGen2SDK:DeviceClient][INFO]: Client hash is: f30a36a9f3842bd3fc16c75b525...
[AriaGen2SDK:DeviceClient][INFO]: Waiting for authentication approval...
Device authentication successful to device 1M0YDB5H7B0020
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Authentication Times Out

**Problem:** The script waits but never completes authentication.

**Solutions:**
* Ensure the Companion App is running in the foreground
* Check that your mobile device has an active internet connection
* Verify notifications are enabled for the Companion App
* Check that you approved the correct pairing request (hash codes should match)

---

### Device Not Found

**Problem:** Error message indicates no device found.

**Solutions:**
* Verify the device is connected via USB
* Run `aria-gen2 device list` to check connectivity
* Ensure `aria-doctor` has been run
* Check USB cable and port connections

---

## Key Concepts

### Authentication vs Connection

* **Authentication**: A one-time security handshake between device and PC (requires Companion App approval)
* **Connection**: Establishing a session with an already-authenticated device (no approval needed)

Once authenticated, you can connect to the device repeatedly without re-authenticating.

### Device Object

The `Device` object returned by `connect()` is your interface for all device operations:

```python
device = device_client.connect()

# Now you can use device for:
# - Recording: device.start_recording()
# - Streaming: device.start_streaming()
# - Commands: device.render_tts("Hello")
# - Info: device.connection_id()
```
