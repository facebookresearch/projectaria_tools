# Text-to-Speech Example

This example demonstrates how to programmatically send text-to-speech (TTS) commands to your Aria Gen2 device using the Python SDK. You can use TTS to provide audio feedback, instructions, or notifications to the device wearer.

## Quick Start

Run the text-to-speech example script:

```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_tts.py --text "Hello from Aria"
```

The device will speak the text through its built-in speakers.

---

## What This Example Does

The script performs the following operations:
1. Connects to the device
2. Sends a text-to-speech command with your specified text
3. The device converts the text to speech and plays it through the speakers
4. Returns once the command is sent (device plays audio asynchronously)

## Code Walkthrough

### Step 1: Import Required Modules

```python
import argparse
import aria.sdk_gen2 as sdk_gen2
```

---

### Step 2: Parse Command-Line Arguments

```python
def parse_args() -> argparse.Namespace:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(
        "--text",
        dest="text",
        type=str,
        default="",
        required=True,
        help="TTS text to rendered by the device.",
    )
    return parser.parse_args()
```

**Required Argument:**
* `--text`: The text string you want the device to speak

---

### Step 3: Connect to Device

```python
device_client = sdk_gen2.DeviceClient()
config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()
device_client.set_client_config(config)

try:
    device = device_client.connect()
    print(f"Connected to device {device.connection_id()}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"Failed to connect: {e}")
    return
```

This establishes a connection to the first available device.

---

### Step 4: Send Text-to-Speech Command

```python
text = args.text
print(f"Sending text-to-speech: '{text}'")
device.render_tts(text)
print("Text-to-speech command sent successfully")
```

**How it works:**
* The `render_tts(text)` method sends the text to the device
* The device processes the text and generates speech
* Audio is played through the device's built-in speakers
* The function returns immediately (audio plays asynchronously)

## Complete Example Code

Here's the full text-to-speech script:

```python
import argparse
import aria.sdk_gen2 as sdk_gen2


def parse_args() -> argparse.Namespace:
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser()
    parser.add_argument(
        "--text",
        dest="text",
        type=str,
        default="",
        required=True,
        help="TTS text to rendered by the device.",
    )
    return parser.parse_args()


if __name__ == "__main__":
    args = parse_args()

    # Set up the device client to initiate connection to the device
    device_client = sdk_gen2.DeviceClient()
    # Set up the device client config to specify the device to be connected to e.g. device serial number.
    # If nothing is specified, the first device in the list of connected devices will be connected to
    config = sdk_gen2.DeviceClientConfig()

    device_client.set_client_config(config)
    device = device_client.connect()
    print(f"Connected to device: {device.connection_id()}")
    print(f"Rendering TTS: {args.text}")
    device.render_tts(text=args.text)
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Simple Message

```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_tts.py --text "Recording started"
```

---

### Multi-Word Message

```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_tts.py --text "Please look at the target"
```

---

### Instructions

```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_tts.py --text "Turn left at the next intersection"
```

---

### Numbers and Punctuation

```bash
python ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/device_tts.py --text "You have 3 notifications. Check your device."
```

The TTS engine handles numbers and punctuation naturally.

## Troubleshooting

### TTS Command Sent But No Audio

**Problem:** The `render_tts()` command succeeds but device doesn't speak.

**Solutions:**
1. **Check device volume:**
   * Ensure device audio is not muted
   * Check volume level in Companion App

2. **Check device status:**
   * Verify device is powered on and functioning
   * Check battery level (low battery may affect audio)

3. **Verify connection:**
   ```python
   device = device_client.connect()
   print(f"Connected: {device.connection_id()}")
   ```

4. **Test with simple message:**
   ```python
   device.render_tts("Test")
   ```

---

### Connection Lost During TTS

**Problem:** Device disconnects when sending TTS.

**Solutions:**
1. **Verify USB connection** is stable
2. **Check authentication:**
   ```bash
   aria_gen2 auth check
   ```
3. **Reconnect if needed:**
   ```python
   try:
       device.render_tts(text)
   except Exception as e:
       print(f"Connection lost: {e}")
       device = device_client.connect()  # Reconnect
       device.render_tts(text)  # Retry
   ```
