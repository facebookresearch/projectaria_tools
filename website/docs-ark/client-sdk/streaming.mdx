# Streaming Control

The ClientSDK provides powerful streaming capabilities that allow you to receive real-time data from your Aria Gen2 device. You can stream sensor data including camera feeds, IMU data, eye tracking, hand tracking, and machine perception outputs.

## Overview

Streaming enables you to access real-time data from your device:
* **Real-time Data Access**: Receive sensor data as it's captured
* **Machine Perception**: Access on-device VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry), eye gaze, and hand pose data
* **Live Visualization**: View streaming data in real-time using the streaming viewer
* **Custom Processing**: Build applications that process streaming data

---

## Choose Your Streaming Method

Select the streaming method that best fits your use case:

| Method | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|------|------|
| **[USB Streaming](#usb-streaming)** | Extended sessions, highest quality | Most reliable, no thermal issues | Requires cable connection |

:::tip Getting Started
**New to streaming?** Start with [USB Streaming](#usb-streaming) - it's the simplest and most reliable method.
:::

## USB Streaming

Stream data over USB connection for maximum bandwidth and reliability. This is the recommended method for getting started and for extended streaming sessions.

### When to Use USB Streaming

* **Extended sessions**: No thermal concerns - stream as long as you need
* **Highest quality**: Maximum bandwidth and lowest latency
* **Simple setup**: Just connect and stream, no network configuration
* **Development**: Best for testing and development work

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Connect device via USB and verify connection
aria_gen2 device list

# 2. Start streaming
aria_gen2 streaming start

# 3. In another terminal, visualize the stream
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time --interpolate

# 4. When done, stop streaming
aria_gen2 streaming stop
```

### USB Streaming Details

**Requirements:**
* Device connected via USB
* Device authenticated (see [Get Started](/ark/client-sdk/start) guide)
* High-quality USB 3.0+ cable recommended

**Command:**
```bash
aria_gen2 streaming start
```

**Default Profile:**
The `mp_streaming_demo` profile is used by default, which provides smooth visualization with VIO, eye gaze, and hand pose data.

### USB Troubleshooting

**Device Not Found:**
```bash
# Check device connectivity
aria_gen2 device list

# If not found, ensure device is authenticated
aria_gen2 auth check
```

**Common Issues:**
* **USB cable**: Try a different high-quality USB 3.0+ cable
* **USB port**: Try a different USB port on your computer
* **Authentication**: Run `aria_gen2 auth pair` if device is not authenticated
* **Recording active**: Stop any active recording with `aria_gen2 recording stop`

## Streaming Commands Reference

### Start Streaming

```bash
aria_gen2 streaming start [OPTIONS]
```

**Options:**

| Option | Values | Default | Description |
|--------|--------|---------|-------------|
| `--profile` | Profile name | `mp_streaming_demo` | Streaming profile |

**Examples:**
```bash
# USB streaming (default)
aria_gen2 streaming start
```

### Stop Streaming

Connect device via USB, then stop streaming:

```bash
aria_gen2 streaming stop
```

### Visualize Streaming Data

Open the streaming viewer in a separate terminal while streaming is active:

```bash
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time --interpolate
```

The viewer shows:
* Live camera feeds (RGB, SLAM, eye tracking)
* Machine perception data (VIO trajectory, eye gaze, hand pose)
* Sensor readings (IMU, magnetometer, etc.)
* Performance metrics (frame rates, latency)

## Streaming vs Recording

Choose the right tool for your needs:

| Feature | Streaming | Recording |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **Real-time Access** | Yes | No |
| **Data Saved on Device** | No | Yes |
| **Machine Perception** | VIO, Eye Gaze, Hand Pose | VIO, Eye Gaze, Hand Pose |
| **Connection Required** | During capture | No |
| **Use Case** | Live monitoring, real-time processing | Data collection for offline analysis |
| **Best For** | Development, live demos, debugging | Research data collection, post-processing |

:::tip
* Use **streaming** when you need to see data in real-time or process it live
* Use **recording** when you need to save data for later analysis or offline processing
:::

## Best Practices

### Choosing the Right Method

* **Development & Testing**: Use USB streaming for reliability and ease
* **Demos & Monitoring**: Use USB streaming with long cables for mobility during short sessions
* **Field Work**: Use hotspot streaming when no network is available
* **Long Sessions**: Always use USB streaming (no thermal concerns)

### General Tips

* **Start Simple**: Begin with USB streaming to verify everything works
* **Test First**: Run a short streaming session before important captures
* **Monitor Temperature**: Watch for device heating during wireless streaming
* **Keep Device Charged**: Wireless streaming consumes more battery
* **Close Applications**: Free up system resources for better performance
* **Use Quality Cables**: USB 3.0+ cables for best USB streaming performance

### Thermal Management

* **If device gets hot**: Stop streaming and let it cool before continuing
* **Extended sessions**: Always prefer USB streaming
