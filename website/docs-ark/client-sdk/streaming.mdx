## USB Streaming

Stream data over USB connection for maximum bandwidth and reliability. This is the recommended method for getting started and for extended streaming sessions.

### When to Use USB Streaming

* **Extended sessions**: No thermal concerns - stream as long as you need
* **Highest quality**: Maximum bandwidth and lowest latency
* **Simple setup**: Just connect and stream, no network configuration
* **Development**: Best for testing and development work

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Connect device via USB and verify connection
aria_gen2 device list

# 2. Start streaming
aria_gen2 streaming start

# 3. In another terminal, visualize the stream
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time --interpolate --rerun-memory-limit 4GB

# 4. When done, stop streaming
aria_gen2 streaming stop
```

### USB Streaming Details

**Requirements:**
* Device connected via USB
* Device authenticated (see [Get Started](/ark/client-sdk/start) guide)
* High-quality USB 3.0+ cable recommended

**Command:**
```bash
aria_gen2 streaming start
```

**Default Profile:**
The `mp_streaming_demo` profile is used by default, which provides smooth visualization with VIO, eye gaze, and hand pose data.

### USB Troubleshooting

**Device Not Found:**
```bash
# Check device connectivity
aria_gen2 device list

# If not found, ensure device is authenticated
aria_gen2 auth check
```

**Common Issues:**
* **USB cable**: Try a different high-quality USB 3.0+ cable
* **USB port**: Try a different USB port on your computer
* **Authentication**: Run `aria_gen2 auth pair` if device is not authenticated
* **Recording active**: Stop any active recording with `aria_gen2 recording stop`

## Wireless Streaming

Wireless streaming allows you to stream data from your Aria Gen2 device over WiFi, eliminating the need for a USB cable. This is useful for untethered development, demos, and testing in various environments.

:::info USB Connection Required for Device Controls
All device controls, including **starting and stopping streaming**, require a USB connection. For wireless streaming:
1. Connect the device via USB to start streaming
2. Unplug the USB cable after streaming has started
3. Plug the device back in via USB when you need to stop streaming
:::

:::warning Thermal Considerations
Wireless streaming generates more heat than USB streaming due to WiFi radio activity. You **must** configure message batching using the `--batch-period-ms` option to manage thermal performance and prevent the device from overheating (thermal throttle at 42°C).
:::

### Message Batching

The `--batch-period-ms` option controls how messages are batched before being sent from the device. This reduces transmission overhead and optimizes thermal performance.

**How it works:**
- Messages are collected and batched over the specified period (in milliseconds)
- Batched messages are sent together, reducing WiFi transmission overhead
- Higher batch periods = better thermal performance but increased latency
- The batch period represents the **worst-case delay** for live streaming

**Trade-off:**
| Batch Period | Thermal Performance | Latency | Use Case |
|--------------|---------------------|---------|----------|
| 100ms | Poor (near thermal limit) | Low | Short demos, testing |
| 200-400ms | Moderate | Medium | General wireless use |
| 500-800ms | Good | High | Extended wireless sessions |

## WiFi Router Streaming

Stream data from Aria devices connected to the same WiFi network as your development machine.

### When to Use WiFi Router Streaming

* **Untethered development**: Move freely without cable constraints
* **Demos**: Show live streaming without visible cables
* **Multi-room testing**: Stream while moving between areas
* **Sessions > 30 minutes**: With appropriate batch period settings

### Prerequisites

1. **Same network**: Both Aria device and computer must be on the same WiFi network
2. **Network ports**: Ensure streaming ports are accessible on your network (default port: 6768)
3. **Device connected**: Connect Aria to your WiFi network via the Companion App or via CLI

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Connect device via USB first for initial setup
aria_gen2 device list

# 2. Verify device is on WiFi (check Companion App)

# 3. Start streaming with batch period for thermal management
#    Use 200ms batch period for a balance of latency and thermal performance
aria_gen2 streaming start --batch-period-ms 200 --interface wifi_sta

# 4. Unplug the USB cable - streaming will continue over WiFi

# 5. In another terminal, visualize the stream
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time --interpolate --rerun-memory-limit 4GB

# 6. When done, plug the USB cable back in, then stop streaming
aria_gen2 streaming stop
```

### Recommended Batch Periods for WiFi Router

*These are preliminary testing results and may vary across environments and devices.*

| Environment | Batch Period | Notes |
|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Cool environment (below 25°C) | `--batch-period-ms 100` | Near thermal limit, monitor closely |
| Normal room temperature | `--batch-period-ms 200` | Recommended starting point |
| Warm environment (above 28°C) | `--batch-period-ms 400` | More conservative for thermal safety |

:::caution
With `--batch-period-ms 100`, we have observed the device nearly reaching thermal throttle (42°C) during WiFi router streaming. Actual thermal behavior depends on your operating environment temperature. Start with higher batch periods and reduce if you need lower latency.
:::

## On-Device Hotspot Streaming

Connect directly to Aria's built-in WiFi hotspot for standalone wireless streaming without requiring external network infrastructure.

### When to Use On-Device Hotspot Streaming

* **Field work**: No external WiFi network available
* **Quick demos**: Simple setup without network configuration
* **Isolated testing**: When you can't access local networks
* **Short sessions only**: Due to high thermal impact

:::danger Important Thermal Warning
**On-device hotspot streaming generates significant heat** because the device acts as both a WiFi access point AND performs streaming simultaneously.

Even with aggressive batching (800ms), the device will overheat during extended use.

**Recommendations:**
- **Do NOT use for sessions longer than 20 minutes**
- Take breaks to let the device cool down
- Monitor device temperature closely
- Consider USB streaming for longer sessions
:::

### Prerequisites

1. **Enable hotspot**: Enable the hotspot feature on Aria via the Companion App
2. **Connect computer**: Connect your development machine to Aria's WiFi hotspot

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Enable hotspot on Aria device via Companion App or CLI:
#    aria_gen2 device hotspot start

# 2. Connect device via USB to start streaming
aria_gen2 device list

# 3. Connect your computer to Aria's WiFi hotspot

# 4. Start streaming with aggressive batching for thermal management
#    800ms batch period is recommended to extend usable time
aria_gen2 streaming start --batch-period-ms 800 --interface --wifi_sap

# 5. Unplug the USB cable - streaming will continue over WiFi hotspot

# 6. In another terminal, visualize the stream
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time --interpolate --rerun-memory-limit 4GB

# 7. When done, plug the USB cable back in, then stop streaming
#    Stop before 20 minutes to prevent overheating
aria_gen2 streaming stop
```

### Recommended Settings for Hotspot Streaming

*These are preliminary testing results and may vary across environments and devices.*

| Session Length | Batch Period | Notes |
|----------------|--------------|-------|
| Under 10 minutes | `--batch-period-ms 500` | Short demo, higher risk |
| 10-20 minutes | `--batch-period-ms 800` | Maximum recommended duration |
| Over 20 minutes | **Not recommended** | Use USB streaming instead |

### Hotspot Streaming Limitations

| Limitation | Impact | Mitigation |
|------------|--------|------------|
| High thermal load | Device overheats | Limit to 20 min sessions max |
| Battery drain | Faster battery consumption | Keep device charged |
| Higher latency | 500-800ms delay | Not suitable for real-time critical applications |
| Single client | Only one device can connect | Use WiFi router for multi-client scenarios |
