# ClientSDK Changelog

This page tracks the version history and changes made to the Aria Gen2 ClientSDK.

---

## Version 2.1.0

**Release Date:** Nov 2025

### ⚠️ Breaking Changes

:::danger Breaking Change
**Device OS V14 (version: 51021960009400500) and V15 (version: 51041610004100500) Compatibility Update**

ClientSDK 2.1.0 introduces a breaking change for recording operations with devices running **OS V14 only**:

- **Recording commands now require the `--disable-tls` flag** when interacting with Aria devices running OS V14
- Existing scripts and workflows that perform recording operations must be updated to include this flag
- This change only affects recording functionality; streaming and other operations remain unchanged

**OS V15 Compatibility:** Devices running OS V15 are fully compatible with ClientSDK 2.1.0 and **do not require** the `--disable-tls` flag. Recording commands work normally without any modifications.

**Example (OS V14 only):**
```bash
# Old command (will fail with OS V14 devices)
aria_gen2 recording list

# New command (required for OS V14 devices)
aria_gen2 recording list --disable-tls

# OS V15 devices (no flag needed)
aria_gen2 recording list
```

**Migration:**
- **OS V14 devices**: Update all recording-related CLI commands and Python scripts to include the `--disable-tls` flag
- **OS V15 devices**: No changes required - all commands work as before

### New Features

#### ROS2 Integration Examples

Added comprehensive ROS2 integration support for advanced users, enabling seamless integration of Aria device data with ROS2 robotics workflows.

**Key additions:**
- Custom ROS2 message type (`AriaRaw`) for transporting raw Aria sensor data
- Publisher example for streaming Aria data to ROS2 topics
- Subscriber example for receiving and processing Aria data in ROS2 nodes
- Support for all sensor types (SLAM cameras, RGB camera, IMU, VIO, eye gaze, hand tracking, etc.)
- Device calibration sharing across ROS2 nodes

**Resources:**
- See the [ROS2 Integration Example](/ark/client-sdk/python-sdk/ros2-example) for detailed setup instructions and code walkthrough

#### Enhanced Data Converter API

Expanded the `OssDataConverter` class with additional functionality for converting raw FlatBuffer messages to typed Python data structures.

**New capabilities:**
- **Message Type Utilities**: Added `MessageType.to_string()` and `MessageType.from_string()` methods for converting between message IDs and their string representations
  ```python
  # Convert message ID to string
  name = sdk_gen2.MessageType.to_string(0x8010)  # "SLAM_CAMERA_FRAME"

  # Convert string to message ID
  msg_id = sdk_gen2.MessageType.from_string("IMU_EVENT")  # 0x8020
  ```

- **SharedMessage Constructor**: Enhanced `SharedMessage` class with constructor for creating messages programmatically
  ```python
  msg = sdk_gen2.SharedMessage(
      id=sdk_gen2.MessageType.IMU_EVENT,
      payload=b'\x00\x01\x02\x03',
      timestampNs=1234567890
  )
  ```

- **Additional Sensor Conversions**: Expanded support for converting various sensor message types:
  - Location sensors: GNSS, phone location
  - Environmental sensors: barometer, magnetometer
  - Wireless beacons: bluetooth (BLE) and WiFi
  - Machine perception: eye gaze, hand tracking, VIO (Visual-Inertial Odometry)
  - Other sensors: audio, PPG (photoplethysmogram)

**Resources:**
- See the [Python API Reference](/technical-specs/client-sdk/api#data-converter) for detailed API documentation

### Improvements

#### Data Converter Performance Optimization

Significantly improved data processing efficiency by leveraging native FlatBuffer serialization from Aria Gen2 devices:

- **Reduced serialization overhead**: The data converter now directly processes FlatBuffer-serialized data from the device, eliminating redundant serialization/deserialization steps

This optimization maintains full API compatibility while delivering better performance across all sensor data types.

#### Documentation & Developer Experience

- Enhanced documentation with detailed code walkthroughs for ROS2 examples
- Added troubleshooting guides for common ROS2 integration issues
- Improved message type handling with string conversion utilities
