:::warning Ubuntu 22.04 Known Issue
If you encounter a `GLIBCXX_3.4.31 not found` error when running CLI commands on Ubuntu 22.04, you'll need to update your C++ standard library.
See the [GLIBCXX troubleshooting guide](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot#glibcxx-error-on-ubuntu-22-linux) for the solution.

## Installation

### Step 1: Install Python

To use ClientSDK, you'll need Python 3.10 - 3.12.
* [Python 3 download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
* To check what version of Python 3 you have, use `python3 --version`

### Step 2: Create a Virtual Environment

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
<TabItem value="unix" label="Linux & macOS">

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/projectaria_gen2_python_env
python3 -m venv $HOME/projectaria_gen2_python_env
source $HOME/projectaria_gen2_python_env/bin/activate
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Step 3: Install ClientSDK Python Package

```bash
pip install projectaria-client-sdk==2.0.0
```

## Device Authentication

You need to authenticate your device with your PC to allow secure connection via USB. Before proceeding, ensure you have [paired the device with your mobile Companion App](/ark/companion-app/start).

### Step 1: Verify Device Setup

After setting up the device with the Companion App, connect your device via USB and run the following command to ensure the device can be reached:

```bash
aria_doctor
```

:::info
This step opens the necessary ports on your PC for device discovery and configures your system to allow unblocked internet connection.
:::

### Step 2: Check Device Connection

Verify the device connection to the PC via USB network interface:

```bash
# Connect device to the computer and check if the device appears
aria_gen2 device list

# Expected output
[AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: 1M0YDB5H7B0020
```

:::warning
If you cannot see your device listed in the terminal, please visit the [troubleshooting](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot) page for help.
:::

### Step 3: Authenticate Device

Authenticate your device to this PC to start using ClientSDK:

```bash
# Authenticate device to connect with the PC
aria_gen2 auth pair

# Expected output
[AriaGen2SDK:DeviceClient][INFO]: Client hash is: f30a36a9f3842bd3fc16c75b525.... please check against the companion app pairing request
[AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: Waiting for authentication approval on your mobile Companion App...
[AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: Successfully authenticated the device
```

You will need to approve the authentication from your mobile Companion App to allow the connection, as shown here:

<ThemedImage
  alt="Docusaurus themed image"
  sources={{
    light: useBaseUrl('/img/docs-ark/client-sdk/ca_approve.png'),
    dark: useBaseUrl('/img/docs-ark/client-sdk/ca_approve.png'),
  }}
  style={{ width: '300px', height: 'auto' }}
/>


:::warning
If you cannot see the authentication request in your Companion App, please visit the [troubleshooting](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot) page for help.
:::

### Step 4: Verify Authentication

Once authenticated, you can check your authentication status using the command below:

```bash
# Check authentication status
aria_gen2 auth check

# Expected output
[AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: Setting up connection to device ...
[AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: Connected to device 1M0YDB5H7B0020
[AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: Device 1M0YDB5H7B0020 is successfully authenticated.
```

:::tip
You only need to authenticate once per device and PC combination.

## Troubleshooting Connection and Authentication

If you're experiencing issues connecting to your device or authenticating, try the following solutions:

### Device Not Detected

If your device is not showing up when running `aria_gen2 device list`, follow these steps:

#### 1. Enable Ports Using aria_doctor

Run `aria_doctor` to configure your system and enable the necessary ports:

```bash
aria_doctor
```

This command will:
* Open required ports on your PC for device discovery
* Configure your system to allow proper USB Ethernet connection
* Set up internet access when connected via USB

:::info
If you cannot connect to the internet when connected to the device via USB, running `aria_doctor` will typically resolve this issue.
:::

#### 2. Check USB Network in Companion App

Ensure USB network is enabled in the Companion App:

1. Open the Aria Companion App on your mobile device
2. Navigate to your paired device settings
3. Verify that **USB Network** is toggled **ON**
4. If it's off, enable it and reconnect the USB cable

:::tip
The USB Network toggle must be enabled for the device to communicate with your PC over USB.
:::

#### 3. Update USB Ethernet Security Settings

When streaming via USB, the USB connection appears as an Ethernet configuration. You may need to adjust the security settings for this connection:

**Linux:**
1. Check network connections with `nmcli device status`
2. Look for a new USB or Ethernet device
3. Ensure NetworkManager is managing the connection
4. In Security tab, disable 802-1x Security for the USB Network

#### 4. Disable VPN

Your local PC may be connected to a VPN that blocks the connection. VPNs can interfere with the USB network interface used by the device.

**Steps to resolve:**
1. Disconnect from any active VPN connections
2. Run `aria_gen2 device list` again to check if the device is detected
3. If streaming, restart the streaming viewer after disabling VPN

```bash
# After disabling VPN, verify device connection
aria_gen2 device list
```

:::warning
Some corporate VPNs may automatically reconnect. You may need to temporarily disable auto-connect features while working with the device.
:::

### Authentication Issues

If authentication is failing or you cannot see the authentication request in the Companion App:

#### 1. Verify Device Connection

Ensure the device is properly connected and detected:

```bash
# Check if device is listed
aria_gen2 device list

# If not listed, run aria_doctor
aria_doctor
```

#### 2. Check Companion App Connection

* Ensure the Companion App is running on your mobile device
* Verify the device is paired with the Companion App
* Check that your mobile device has an active internet connection
* Make sure the Companion App is running in the foreground

#### 3. Retry Authentication

```bash
# Stop any existing authentication attempts
# Press Ctrl+C if a command is hanging

# Retry authentication
aria_gen2 auth pair
```

#### 4. Reset Connection

If authentication continues to fail, try resetting the connection:

```bash
# Disconnect and reconnect the USB cable
# Wait a few seconds after reconnecting

# Run aria_doctor again
aria_doctor

# Check device connection
aria_gen2 device list

# Retry authentication
aria_gen2 auth pair
```

---

### Additional Troubleshooting Steps

If you're still experiencing issues:

1. **Try a Different USB Port**: Use a different USB port on your computer, preferably USB 3.0+
2. **Try a Different USB Cable**: Use a high-quality USB cable that supports data transfer
3. **Restart the Device**: Power off and restart your Aria Gen2 device
4. **Restart Your Computer**: Sometimes a system restart can resolve network configuration issues
5. **Check Device Battery**: Ensure your device has sufficient battery charge
6. **Update ClientSDK**: Ensure you have the latest version of the ClientSDK installed

```bash
# Update ClientSDK to the latest version
pip install --upgrade projectaria-client-sdk
```

For more detailed troubleshooting, visit the [troubleshooting page](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot).

## Available CLI Controls

The ClientSDK provides a powerful CLI to control your Aria Gen2 device. You can use the packaged CLI to:

* **Recording**: Control the device to start, stop, list, and download recordings in VRS format
* **Streaming**: Control the device to start and stop streaming
* **Device**: General device controls including obtaining device information, connecting to Wi-Fi, sending text-to-speech, and more

For detailed instructions and command reference, refer to the [Technical Specs](/technical-specs/client-sdk/cli) page.

## Next Steps

Now that you have the ClientSDK installed and your device authenticated, you can:

1. Explore the [Recording](/ark/client-sdk/recording) guide to learn how to capture data
2. Check out the [Streaming](/ark/client-sdk/streaming) documentation to stream data in real-time
3. Visit the [Technical Specs](/technical-specs/client-sdk/cli) for comprehensive CLI command reference
4. Review the [Python SDK API Reference](/technical-specs/client-sdk/api) for detailed Python SDK API documentation
