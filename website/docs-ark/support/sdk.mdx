## Quick Diagnostic Commands

Before diving into specific issues, use these commands to check your device status:

```bash
# Check device connectivity
aria_gen2 device list

# Check authentication status
aria_gen2 auth check

# Verify system configuration
aria_doctor
```

---

## Device Connection Issues

### Device Not Detected

If your device is not showing up when running `aria_gen2 device list`, follow these solutions in order:

#### Solution 1: Run aria_doctor

The `aria_doctor` command configures your system for device communication:

```bash
aria_doctor
```

This command will:
* Open required ports on your PC for device discovery
* Configure your system to allow proper USB Ethernet connection
* Set up internet access when connected via USB

:::tip
If you cannot connect to the internet when connected to the device via USB, running `aria_doctor` typically resolves this issue.
:::

---

#### Solution 2: Update USB Ethernet Security Settings

When connecting via USB, the connection appears as an Ethernet configuration. You may need to adjust security settings:

**Linux Instructions:**

1. Check network connections:
   ```bash
   nmcli device status
   ```
2. Look for a new USB or Ethernet device
3. Ensure NetworkManager is managing the connection
4. Disable Security in USB networking interface

---

#### Solution 3: Disable VPN

VPNs can interfere with the USB network interface used by the device:

**Steps to resolve:**
1. Disconnect from any active VPN or Lighthouse connections
2. Run `aria_gen2 device list` to check if the device is detected
3. If successful, streaming and device control should work

```bash
# After disabling VPN, verify device connection
aria_gen2 device list
```

:::warning
Some corporate VPNs may automatically reconnect. You may need to temporarily disable auto-connect features while working with the device.
:::

* Notifications are enabled for the Companion App

---

#### Solution 3: Retry Authentication

```bash
# Stop any existing authentication attempts
# Press Ctrl+C if a command is hanging

# Retry authentication
aria_gen2 auth pair
```

**When the command runs:**
1. Check your Companion App for the authentication request
2. Verify the hash code shown matches between PC and Companion App
3. Approve the authentication in the Companion App
4. Wait for confirmation on PC

---

#### Solution 4: Reset Connection

If authentication continues to fail:

```bash
# 1. Disconnect and reconnect the USB cable
# Wait a few seconds after reconnecting

# 2. Run aria_doctor again
aria_doctor

# 3. Check device connection
aria_gen2 device list

# 4. Retry authentication
aria_gen2 auth pair
```

---

#### Solution 5: Check Authentication Status

If you've previously authenticated, verify the status:

```bash
aria_gen2 auth check

# Expected output if authenticated:
# [AriaGen2Cli:App][INFO]: Device <serial> is successfully authenticated.
```

:::tip
You only need to authenticate once per device and PC combination. If already authenticated, you don't need to authenticate again.

### GLIBCXX Error on Ubuntu 22 (Linux)

**Symptoms:** When running CLI commands on Ubuntu 22, you may see an error like:

```
GLIBCXX_3.4.31 not found
```

**Cause:** The system's C++ standard library (`libstdc++6`) is outdated and doesn't have the required version.

**Solution:**

Update the C++ standard library by installing a newer compiler toolchain:

```bash
# 1. Check current libstdc++6 version
sudo apt list --installed | grep libstdc++6

# 2. Add the Ubuntu toolchain PPA repository
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test

# 3. Update package list
sudo apt update

# 4. Install the newer g++ compiler (which includes the updated library)
sudo apt install g++-13
```

After installation, try running your CLI command again. The updated `libstdc++6` library should now be available.

:::info
This issue is specific to Ubuntu 22.04 and earlier versions. Ubuntu 24 and later typically have the required library version by default.
