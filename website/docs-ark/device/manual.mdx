## Controls and Hardware Features

The glasses include several built-in controls:

- **Privacy Switch:** Controls whether the device can record data. When set to the rear and the red underneath is visible, recording is disabled and any ongoing recordings are deleted.
- **Action Button:** Starts and ends recording sessions. This button can be customized to perform other actions (e.g., start a livestream).
- **Power Button:** Turns the device on and off.
- **USB Port:** Uses a standard USB-C cable.
- **Volume Control:** Adjusts the speaker volume.

## Visual and Audio Indicators

Aria Gen 2 uses LEDs and speakers to communicate device status to both the wearer and bystanders.

### LED Indicators

There are three main LEDs:

- **Inner LED:** Visible only to the wearer, primarily communicates device state and events.
- **Bystander LED:** Visible to bystanders, indicates when the device is recording or streaming data from sensors.
- **Power LED:** Located above the power button on the inner right arm, indicates battery and charging status (not visible while wearing).

### Audio Feedback

- **Earcons:** Non-verbal sounds (e.g., camera shutter, error beeps) indicate device states.
- **TTS (Text-to-Speech):** Spoken messages (e.g., “Glasses shutting down”, “Battery ten percent: charge soon”) provide status updates.

## Power and Charging

Only use a USB-C cable to charge your glasses. When first plugged in, a red flashing light inside the right arm indicates the battery is $<$5% but charging.

To turn the device on, press and hold the power button for 3 seconds. When booting is complete, the power LED will turn solid blue for 3 seconds before fading. You can also turn on your glasses by plugging them into a power source; wait for the blue LED before disconnecting the charger.

To turn the device off, hold the power button for 3 seconds and release it. The blue LED will start blinking and then turn off after a short delay, and you will hear an earcon confirming shutdown.

## Resetting the Device

### Force Reset

A force reset immediately reboots your device, preserving all data. Use this if the device is unresponsive.

1. Toggle the privacy switch forward (orange not visible).
2. Hold both the action and power buttons for 3 seconds.
3. Wait for the device to reboot.

### Factory Reset

A factory reset erases all local data, including recordings.

1. Toggle the privacy switch to the rear (orange visible).
2. Tap (do not hold) the power and action buttons simultaneously.
3. The device will reboot and the status LED will flash blue.
4. The device is now ready to be paired.

> **Warning:** Factory reset will delete all local data.
