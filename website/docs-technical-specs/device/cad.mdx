## Glasses Mount Reference Design:

The Aria Gen 2 glasses can be mounted using the following design files as a reference. The two reference CAD files differ by frame width. Additionally, the designs can accommodate either an open or close hinge application. In these files, they are designed to be compatible with a standard camera mount, ¼”-20 insert (McMaster PN: [93365A160](https://www.mcmaster.com/93365A160/)). A 16mm diameter o-ring is used to retain the glasses to the mount (McMaster PN: [1174N407](https://www.mcmaster.com/1174N407/)).
