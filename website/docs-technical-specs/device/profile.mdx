# Project Aria Gen 2 Profiles
Project Aria Gen 2 glasses offer a range of profiles, allowing users to select the optimal configuration of sensors and settings for their research or application needs. Each profile defines a specific combination of sensor streams, data rates, resolutions, and encoding formats. These profiles are designed to balance data quality, device performance, and operational stability.
Profiles are divided into two categories:
- **Pre-defined profiles**: Thoroughly tested, stable, and fully supported. Recommended for most users.
- **Custom profiles**: User-defined configurations for advanced or experimental use. These may not be stable and are not recommended for general use. A [custom profile example](#custom_profile_example) is provided below.

The table below details the specifications of the currently supported pre-defined profiles. New profiles may be added as the platform evolves.

## Profile Usage Recommendations

### When to Use Pre-defined Profiles

**Pre-defined profiles (profile8, profile9, profile10, mp_streaming_demo)** are:
- ✅ Thoroughly tested and validated
- ✅ Optimized for device stability and thermal performance
- ✅ Fully supported by all downstream tools
- ✅ Guaranteed to work reliably
- ✅ Recommended for production use and research studies

**Recommended for:**
- Production deployments
- Large-scale data collection
- Research studies requiring reliable data
- Users who want maximum compatibility
- First-time Aria users

### When to Consider Custom Profiles

**Custom profiles** may be appropriate for:
- Advanced research with specific sensor requirements
- Prototyping new applications
- Experimental configurations
- Specialized use cases not covered by pre-defined profiles

**⚠️ Important:** Custom profiles should only be used by advanced users who understand the risks and limitations.

---

## Custom Profiles {#custom_profile_example}

### Overview

Custom profiles allow advanced users to define their own sensor configurations for specialized research needs. However, **custom profiles come with significant risks and limitations** and should be used with caution.

### ⚠️ Important Considerations and Risks

Before creating a custom profile, understand these critical limitations:

#### 1. Device Stability and Data Quality

**Thermal and Power Issues:**
- Custom profiles that push sensor settings (e.g., high frame rates, high resolutions, enabling many sensors simultaneously) can cause the device to **overheat** or **drain the battery rapidly**
- This can lead to **unexpected shutdowns** or **reduced recording/streaming times**
- Some combinations may trigger warnings in the Aria Companion App, but **not all edge cases are covered automatically**
- Using extreme values or not basing your custom profile on a tested template **significantly increases these risks**

**Data Quality Risks:**
- Unusual sensor configurations may result in:
  - Poor data quality
  - Synchronization issues between sensors
  - Missing data streams
  - Inconsistent sensor performance
- **These issues may not be immediately apparent** and could compromise your research data

**Fragmented Datasets:**
- Custom profiles can lead to fragmented datasets, making it harder to:
  - Compare data across different studies
  - Aggregate data from multiple users
  - Reproduce research results
- This **reduces the overall utility** of the data for broader research purposes

#### 2. Compatibility and Downstream Tooling

**Tooling Incompatibility:**
- Downstream tools (e.g., Project Aria Tools, MPS, analytics pipelines) **may not be fully compatible** with all custom profile configurations
- Data recorded with custom profiles may:
  - Not be processed correctly by standard tools
  - Require additional engineering work to support new formats
  - Be incompatible with existing analysis pipelines

**Lack of Standardization:**
- Custom profiles are **not as thoroughly tested or supported** as pre-defined profiles
- This can lead to:
  - Unexpected issues when using standard tools
  - Difficulties sharing data with collaborators
  - Limited community support

#### 3. Known Bugs and Open Issues

**Sensor Data Retrieval:**
- There have been reports of **issues retrieving certain sensor data** (e.g., GPS) when using custom profiles
- These issues may not be present with recommended pre-defined profiles

**Parameter Guardrails:**
- While the Companion App includes some guardrails, **not all problematic combinations are blocked**
- Users may still encounter hardware or data quality issues when defining profiles via the SDK

**⚠️ Use at Your Own Risk:**
Custom profiles are provided as-is for advanced users. Meta does not guarantee stability, data quality, or tool compatibility for custom profile configurations.

### Custom Profile Template

Below is a template for creating custom profiles. **It is strongly recommended** to base your custom profile on one of the pre-defined profiles (e.g., profile8) rather than starting from scratch.

This example is based on **profile8** with the following modifications:
- **RGB frame rate**: Reduced from 10Hz to 5Hz
- **SLAM camera frame rate**: Reduced from 30Hz to 10Hz
- **Hand tracking**: Reduced from 30Hz to 10Hz

### Template Notes

This example demonstrates a **conservative approach** to customization: making minimal changes to a tested profile (profile8) to reduce power consumption while maintaining core functionality.

## Best Practices for Custom Profiles

If you must use a custom profile, follow these guidelines:

### 1. Start from a Pre-defined Profile
- ✅ Base your custom profile on profile8, profile9, or profile10
- ✅ Make incremental changes rather than dramatic modifications
- ❌ Avoid starting with a blank profile or extreme parameter values

### 2. Test Thoroughly
- Test the profile with short recordings first
- Monitor device temperature during use
- Check battery consumption rates
- Verify all expected sensor streams are present
- Validate data quality before large-scale data collection

### 3. Monitor Device Health
- Watch for thermal warnings in the Companion App
- Note any unexpected shutdowns or errors
- Track recording duration vs. battery life
- Monitor data completeness and quality

### 4. Conservative Parameter Selection
- **Frame rates**: Lower rates reduce power and thermal load
- **Resolution**: Higher resolutions increase data size and processing
- **Encoding quality**: Lower QP values (higher quality) increase bitrate
- **Sensor combinations**: Enabling all sensors simultaneously increases load

### 5. Validate Data Compatibility
- Test with Project Aria Tools to ensure data can be loaded
- Verify compatibility with your analysis pipeline
- Check that all required sensor streams are accessible
- Consider data sharing and reproducibility needs

### 6. Document Your Configuration
- Keep detailed records of custom profile parameters
- Document the rationale for each modification
- Note any issues or limitations encountered
- Share configuration details with collaborators

## Parameter Guidelines

When modifying parameters, consider these general guidelines:

| Parameter Type | Considerations |
|---------------|---------------|
| **Frame Rates** | Higher rates = more data, higher power consumption, thermal load |
| **Resolution** | Higher resolution = larger files, more processing, better quality |
| **Encoding Quality (QP)** | Lower QP (e.g., 18) = higher quality, larger files; Higher QP (e.g., 30) = lower quality, smaller files |
| **Sensor Combinations** | More active sensors = higher power draw, more thermal stress |
| **Bitrate** | Fixed bitrate (CBR) for consistent file sizes; Variable rate (CQP) for consistent quality |
