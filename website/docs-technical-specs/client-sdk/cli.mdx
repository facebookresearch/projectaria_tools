## Diagnostic and Utility Tools

The following standalone CLI tools help with device setup, troubleshooting, and data visualization.

### `aria_doctor`

Resolve internet connectivity issues and configure open ports when first connecting to the device.

This tool helps troubleshoot and fix common networking problems when setting up a new device connection.

```bash
aria_doctor
```

### `aria_diagnostics`

Collect error logs and diagnostic information from the device and save them to `diagnostics.zip`.

This tool is useful for troubleshooting device issues and gathering logs for support.

```bash
aria_diagnostics
```

The diagnostic archive will be saved as `diagnostics.zip` in the current directory.

:::tip Linux Users
If `aria_diagnostics` fails to run, you may need to install `net-tools`:
```bash
sudo apt install net-tools
```
:::

### `aria_streaming_viewer`

Visualize real-time streaming data from the device.

This tool provides a live view of sensor data streams, including images, IMU data, and other sensor outputs.

**Options:**
- `--real-time`: Enable real-time streaming mode with reduced queue sizes to minimize latency (default: disabled)
- `--interpolate`: Interpolate hand pose data for smoother visualization (default: use closest data point)
- `--jpeg-quality <quality>`: Set JPEG quality for image visualization, range 1-100 (default: 50)

```bash
# Basic usage
aria_streaming_viewer

# Enable real-time mode with minimal latency
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time

# Enable hand pose interpolation
aria_streaming_viewer --interpolate

# Set custom JPEG quality
aria_streaming_viewer --jpeg-quality 80

# Combine options
aria_streaming_viewer --real-time --interpolate --jpeg-quality 75
```

:::info
The device must be streaming data before launching the viewer. Use `aria_gen2 streaming start` to begin streaming. If you encounter issues, see the [Viewer Not Showing Data](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot#viewer-not-showing-data-usb) troubleshooting guide.

## Additional Resources

For troubleshooting common issues with device connection, authentication, recording, or streaming, please refer to the [Troubleshooting Guide](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot).

**Key points:**
- Most commands require a connected device (via USB)
- Authentication (`auth pair`) must be performed before first use
- Recording and streaming cannot run simultaneously
- If you encounter connection issues, run `aria_doctor` to resolve networking problems
- For detailed troubleshooting steps, see the [Troubleshooting Guide](/ark/client-sdk/troubleshoot)
