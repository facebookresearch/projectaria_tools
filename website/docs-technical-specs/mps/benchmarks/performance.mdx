# Hand Tracking Algorithm Benchmark

This page presents the performance evaluation of the MPS Hand Tracking algorithm for Aria Gen2 glasses.

## Benchmark Dataset

The MPS Hand Tracking algorithm is benchmarked on an internal dataset specifically designed for **hand-object interaction (HOI)** scenarios. These scenarios are particularly valuable for robotics applications and present significant challenges for hand tracking due to object-induced occlusions.

### Dataset Specifications

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| Total Duration | 1 hour |
| Frame Rate | 30 fps |
| Cameras Used | All 4 CV cameras on Aria Gen2 |
| Number of Participants | 7 |
| Number of Objects | 20 everyday objects |

### Participant Diversity

Seven participants were recruited to ensure diversity across:
- Ethnicity
- Age
- Gender
- Hand size
- Arm length

### Recording Scenarios

Each participant was asked to interact naturally with a pool of 20 everyday objects. The dataset captures:

- **Frequent hand occlusions** from objects or the other hand during natural interaction
- **Out-of-field-of-view segments** where subjects' hands move outside the Aria Gen2 field of view

These challenging scenarios provide an end-to-end evaluation signal for Aria Gen2 hand tracking performance.

## Ground Truth Annotations

Hand pose ground truth annotations follow the standard **[UmeTrack format](https://github.com/facebookresearch/UmeTrack)** and are generated using an internal marker-free reconstruction system with **millimeter-level keypoint accuracy**.

Thanks to the extensive field-of-view coverage of outside-in cameras in the reconstruction system, nearly all frames in the 1-hour VRS dataset have valid hand pose ground truth annotations.

## Evaluation Metrics

We report the following metrics (lower is better for both):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **MKPE** (Mean Keypoint Error) | Average Euclidean distance between predicted and ground truth keypoints, measured in millimeters |
| **LTR** (Lose Track Ratio) | Percentage of frames where tracking is lost |

## Results

| Method | MKPE (mm) ↓ | LTR (%) ↓ |
|--------|-------------|-----------|
| On-device HT | 45.0 | 12.7 |
| MPS HT (3.1.1) | 20.1 | 8.6 |
