## Online calibration

`online_calibration.jsonl` contains one json online calibration record per line. Each record is a json dict object that contains timestamp metadata and the result of online calibration for the cameras and IMUs.

The calibration parameters contain intrinsics and extrinsics parameters for each sensor as well as a time offsets which best temporally align their data.
