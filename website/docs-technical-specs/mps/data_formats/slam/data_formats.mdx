# MPS Output - SLAM

## Overview
This section covers SLAM Machine Perception Services (MPS). SLAM and Multi-SLAM outputs may be part of Open Dataset Releases or Project Aria Partners can request MPS services on their own data.

SLAM outputs are available for all recordings made with CV cameras and IMU enabled. Partner data is not made available to Meta researchers or Meta's affiliates. Go to [MPS Data Lifecycle](/ark/mps/mps_data_lifecycle) for more details about how partner data is processed and stored.


The following outputs are generated if you request SLAM data using the [MPS CLI](/technical-specs/mps/mps_cli_guide):
* [6DoF Trajectory](mps_trajectory.mdx)
* [Semi-Dense Point Cloud](mps_pointcloud.mdx)
* [Online Sensor Calibration](mps_calibration.mdx)
