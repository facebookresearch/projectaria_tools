title: VRS command line tool

The `vrs` command line tool is a Swiss army knife utility to manipulate VRS files (operations such as inspection, or copy/filter editing).

:::Note
VRS file format has been created to be immutable, but files can be copied, record-by-record, and during copies, certain transformations can be applied.

## File validation

_Commands: `check`, `checksum`

### File Integrity Validation

The `check` command "simply" decodes every record in the VRS file and prints how many records were decoded successfully. It proves that the VRS file is correct at the VRS level.

```bash
vrs check file.vrs
```

### Checksums

A logical data checksum can be generated for a VRS file. Could be use to ensure data integrity while doing VRS file transfer/Download when providing datasets.

```bash
vrs checksum file.vrs
```

## File inspection

To peek into a VRS file, simply run:

```bash
vrs sample_file.vrs
```

It will print a lot of information, that can be overwhelming the first time you see what's in a VRS file!

To have a simpler view and list only the the available streams and number of records you can do:

```bash
vrs sample_file.vrs | grep records
```

## Trimming

You will find here instructions on how to TRIM data from an existing VRS file (instructions can be combined):
- Trimming by stream_id
- Trimming by time

### Stream removal

_Options: `[+|-]<stream_id>`

As an example, we are here removing the EyeTracking stream (["211-1"]):

```bash
vrs copy original.vrs --to new.vrs - 211
```

### Time cropping

_Options: `--before [+|-]<max-timestamp>`, `--after [+|-]<min-timestamp>`, ` --range [+|-]<min-timestamp> [+|-]<max-timestamp>`, `--around [+|-]<timestamp> <time-range>`._

To use _relative timing, i.e 10 seconds of a file while skipping the first 2 seconds of data records, use:

```bash
vrs copy original.vrs --to new.vrs --range +2 +12
```

You can also choose to trim only from a given relative time with (i.e. keep everything after the first 2 seconds):

```bash
vrs copy original.vrs --to new.vrs --after +2
```

To use _absolute timestamps, use:

```bash
vrs copy original.vrs --to new.vrs --range 149002622 158702622
```
