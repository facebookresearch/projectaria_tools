# Project Aria VRS

## Overview

This page provides an overview of how Project Aria uses [VRS](https://facebookresearch.github.io/vrs/). The other pages in this section are:

## How Project Aria uses VRS

Project Aria chose VRS as its data container because it is a file format designed to record and playback streams of [XR (extended reality)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality) sensor data and supports huge file sizes. These VRS files contain streams of time-sorted records generated for each sensor, with one set of sensors per stream. Project Aria data uses VRS for features such as:

* Records are structured as a succession of typed content blocks.
* Project Aria Tools recordings are structured following this VRS <code>[DataLayout](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/core/data_provider/data_layout)</code>. These definitions provide an overview of what information can be extracted for each stream from a Project Aria sequence.
* Streams contain <code>Configuration</code>, <code>State</code> and <code>Data</code> records, each with a timestamp in a common time domain for the whole file.
* Playback is optimized for timestamp order, which is key for network streaming.
* Random-access playback is supported via VRS.
