# MPS output - Calibration

Online calibration is generated as part of SLAM (Location in the Desktop Companion app) [MPS requests](/ARK/mps/mps.mdx).

* `online_calibration.jsonl` file

The [Aria Sensor Viewer](/data_utilities/visualization/visualization_python.mdx#run-aria-sensor-viewer) displays the relative position and orientation of most Project Aria glasses sensors (cameras, IMUs, microphones, magnetometer & barometer) in a common reference.

Static camera calibration may also be available in some datasets that include stationary cameras as well as moving Project Aria glasses.

* The name of the static camera calibration .csv file may vary between projects


## Online calibration

The JSONL file contains one json online calibration record per line. Each record is a json dict object that contains timestamp metadata and the result of online calibration for the cameras and IMUs. The calibration parameters contain [intrinsics](/tech_insights/camera_intrinsic_models.mdx) and [extrinsics](/data_formats/coordinate_convention/3d_coordinate_frame_convention.mdx) parameters for each sensor as well as a time offsets which best temporally align their data. For how to load and read online calibrations in Python and C++, please check the [code example](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps.mdx#online-calibration)
