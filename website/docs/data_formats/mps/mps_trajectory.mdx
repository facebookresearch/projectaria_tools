# MPS output - Trajectory

Standard [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/docs/ARK/mps) outputs are:

* Open loop trajectory .csv file
* Closed loop trajectory .csv file
* Online calibration JSON files
* Static camera calibration .csv file

When requesting MPS, Semi-Dense Point Cloud can be requested as an addition to Trajectory services.

## Open loop trajectory

Open loop trajectory is the high frequency (IMU rate, which is 1kHz) odometry estimation output by the visual-inertial odometry (VIO), in an arbitrary odometry coordinate frame. The estimation includes pose and dynamics (translational and angular velocities).

The open loop trajectory has good “relative” and “local” accuracy: the relative transformation between two poses is accurate when the time span between two frames is short (within a few minutes). However, the open loop trajectory has increased drift error accumulated over time spent and travel distance. Consider using closed loop trajectory if you are looking for trajectory without drift error.

For the utility function to load the open loop trajectory in Python and C++, please check the [code examples](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps#open-loopclosed-loop-trajectory)

## Closed loop trajectory

Closed loop trajectory is the high frequency (IMU rate, which is 1kHz) pose estimation output by our mapping process, in an arbitrary gravity aligned world coordinate frame. The estimation includes pose and dynamics (translational and angular velocities).

Closed loop trajectories are fully bundle adjusted with detected loop closures, reducing the VIO drift which is present in the open loop trajectories. However, due to the loop closure correction, the “relative” and “local” trajectory accuracy within a short time span (i.e. seconds) might be worse compared to open loop trajectories.

In some open datasets we also share and use this format for trajectory pose ground truth from simulation or Optitrack, and the files will be called in a different file name aria_gt_trajectory.csv.

## Online calibration

JSON files contain one json online calibration record per line. Each record is a json dict object that contains timestamp metadata and the result of online calibration for the cameras and IMUs. The calibration parameters contain [intrinsics](/docs/tech_insights/camera_intrinsic_models)) and [extrinsics](/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/3d_coordinate_frame_convention) parameters for each sensor as well as a time offsets which best temporally align their data. For how to load and read online calibrations in Python and C++, please checkout the [code examples](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps#online-calibration)

Poses and intrinsic calibration of a set of stationary cameras. For the utility function to load the static cameras in Python and C++, please check the [code examples](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps#static-camera-calibration)
