# Aria Client SDK & CLI Setup Guide

## Overview

The page provides instructions about how to get started with the Project Aria Client SDK, covering:

* [Hardware and SW Requirements](#requirements)
* [Download and install the SDK](#install)
    * Installing `projectaria_client_sdk` via pip will also add the [Aria CLI](/docs/ARK/sdk/cli/cli.mdx) to your PATH
* [Run Project Aria Doctor](#doctor)
* [Pairing your Aria Glasses](#pair)
* [How to download and explore the sample apps](#explore)


<div id="requirements"></div>

## Requirements

### Hardware
- Project Aria glasses that have:
  - Completed full device setup using the [Aria Mobile Companion App](/docs/ARK/about_ARK#mobile-companion-app-requirements)
  - [Latest up-to-date OS](/docs/ARK/sw_release_notes)
- If you want to stream over Wi-Fi, you'll need a router, such as Asus, Netgear or TP-Link, that has:
  - No firewall
  - Supports Wi-Fi 6
    - So that the glasses can connect to the 5GHz band when streaming over Wi-Fi

### Platforms
The codebase is supported for the following platforms:
- Fedora 36 or newer
- Ubuntu 22.04 or newer
- Mac Intel or Mac ARM-based (M1)
  - Mac Big Sur or newer

### Software
* Python 3.8-3.11
  * Python 3.9+ if you want to use the device_stream code sample
    * This is because of a fastplotlib dependency
  * [Python 3 download page](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
  * To check what version of Python 3 you have, use `python3 --version`
* PyPi
  * Use [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the software in a virtual environment
* [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) (optional)
  * In addition to the CLI, you can use ADB to interact with Aria glasses
  * ADB is one of the ways that you can [download Aria data](/docs/ARK/ARK_quickstart#download-data)

## Environment Setup

## Step 1: Install SDK from PyPi

### Create a virtual environment

When using pip, it is best practice to use a virtual environment. This will keep all the modules under one folder and will not break your local environment. Use the following command with your version of Python3.

```bash
python3 -m venv ~/venv
```

### Install the Client SDK and CLI

Installing `projectaria_client_sdk` through pip will install the Aria Client SDK and add the [Aria CLI](/docs/ARK/sdk/cli/cli.mdx) to your PATH.

Use the following commands for MacOS, Fedora or Ubuntu, with your version of Python.

<!-- TODO: Remove --extra-index-url and test.pypi url -->

```bash
source ~/venv/bin/activate

python -m pip install projectaria_client_sdk --extra-index-url https://test.pypi.org/simple --no-cache-dir
```

<div id="doctor"></div>

## Step 2: Run Project Aria Doctor utility

The Project Aria Doctor utility can help detect and resolve common issues connecting and streaming from the glasses.

Run the utility using the following command and follow the prompts to resolve any issues.

```bash
aria-doctor
```
:::info
If you're on MacOS and lose internet connection while streaming, run `aria-doctor` in a separate terminal.
:::

</div>

## Step 3: Pair Aria Glasses with your computer

Pairing your Aria glasses to your computer will let the Client SDK control the glasses and run the sample apps.

Follow these steps with every computer you want to have permission to connect to your Aria glasses:


1. Connect your Aria glasses to your computer, using the provided cable
3. Open the Mobile Companion app on your phone
4. On your computer, run:

```
aria auth pair
```

5. A prompt should then appear in the Mobile app, tap **Approve** to pair your glasses
    * The hash in the terminal and the app should be the same
    * View (or revoke) certificates by going to [Device Settings](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#aria-device-settings)
    * The Client SDK Certificate will remain valid until you manually revoke it or factory reset your glasses

</div>

:::info
At this point, you can now use the [Aria CLI](docs/ARK/sdk/cli/cli.mdx) to interact with you Aria glasses.

## Step 4: Explore sample apps

### Extract the code samples and install necessary dependencies

1. Extract the Client SDK code samples (here to your home directory)

```bash
python -m aria.extract_sdk_samples --output ~
```

2. Navigate to the sample folder

```bash
cd ~/projectaria_client_sdk_samples
```

3. Install necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Explore the apps


Go to [Sample Apps](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/samples.mdx) to explore Aria Client SDK features. Each code sample page starts with commands you can just run from the samples directory, followed by a detailed walkthrough of the code used.

We recommend starting with [device_connect.py](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection) to validate that your Aria glasses have connected successfully.

If you encounter any issues please run `aria-doctor` in a separate terminal or check out [troubleshooting](/docs/ARK/sdk/sdk_troubleshooting).

:::info
You can check your Aria glasses' recording or streaming status in the [Mobile Companion app](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app).
:::

:::danger
The Client SDK does not currently support streaming over corporate, university or public networks. Those networks are protected by many layers of security and firewalls. We recommend using one of the recommended routers listed above to stream over Wi-Fi.
:::

### Explore the Client SDK

The examples only show some of the Client SDK's capabilities. Go to [API Reference](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference) to see what else is possible.

<!-------ONCE BUILT OUT----->
<!--- Go to [Streaming Internals](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals) for more information about streaming data------>

### End any streaming sessions and disconnect Aria

Once you've finished exploring, end any streaming sessions and disconnect Aria glasses to free up system resources. This is built into all the code snippets we provide.
