# Project Aria Client SDK and CLI

The Project Aria Client SDK provides robust capabilities for creating computer vision and machine learning applications with Project Aria glasses. CLI capabilities are also installed as part of the SDK.


### Client SDK and CLI capabilities



```mdx-code-block
<Tabs groupId="cli-sdk-capabilities">
<TabItem value="sdk" label="SDK">
```

Through the SDK you can:
- Connect and disconnect from the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Retrieve detailed device information and its current status
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities
- Access calibration data for the sensors you're recording with
- Subscribe and listen to Aria sensor data
- Visualize streaming data

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="cli" label="CLI">
```

Through the CLI, you can:
- Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
- Control Aria recording capabilities
- Control Aria streaming capabilities

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
