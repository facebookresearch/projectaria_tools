# Project Aria Client SDK Code Samples


This section provides code samples and walkthroughs for using the Aria Client SDK to interact with the Project Aria glasses.

* [Connection](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection.mdx)
    * Connect to the Aria glasses using USB and Wi-Fi
    * Fetch device information, such as the device serial number
    * Fetch device status, such as battery level or Wi-Fi SSID.
* [Recording](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_recording.mdx)
    * Start and stop recording on an Aria device via USB and Wi-Fi
    * Set a [recording profile](/tech_spec/recording_profiles.mdx) for a recording
* [Streaming Subscription](/ARK/sdk/samples/streaming_subscribe.mdx)
    * Subscribe to and unsubscribe from a streaming session
    * Visualize the live stream
* [Streaming and Visualizing All Live Sensor Data](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_stream.mdx)
    * Start and stop streaming from an Aria device to a computer via USB and Wi-Fi
    * Add callbacks to visualize and manipulate the streamed data
* [Streaming Undistorted RGB Image Using Calibration](/ARK/sdk/samples/undistort_rgb_image.mdx)
    * Start and stop streaming from an Aria device to a computer via USB and Wi-Fi
    * Access sensor calibration and undistort an RGB live stream
* [TICSync Time Synchronization](/ARK/sdk/samples/ticsync_sample.mdx)
    * Requires at least two Project Aria glasses
    * Deeper dive and more granular control of features than commands provided in [How to Create Time Synchronized Recordings with Multiple Aria Glasses](/ARK/sdk/ticsync.mdx)

Make sure you have finished the [Setup Guide](/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx).

We recommend starting with [device_connect.py](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection.mdx) to validate that your Aria glasses have connected successfully.
