# Make a Recording Using the Client SDK

## Overview
This `device_record` example shows how to set a [recording profile](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles), start and stop recording using the [Project Aria Client SDK](/docs/ARK/sdk).

## Running the sample

### Example 1: Start and stop recording over USB
Use the SDK to establish a USB connection, start a 10 second recording using the [default recording profile](/docs/ARK/ARK_quickstart#set-your-default-recording-profile), then stop the recording.

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the provided USB cable
2. From the samples directory in Terminal, run:
```
python -m device_record
```

3. The recording LED will show on your Aria glasses
4. After 10 seconds the recording will stop and be stored in your Aria glasses
   * View the recording metadata in the Recordings tab of the [Mobile Companion app](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#recordings-menu)
   * Run `adb shell ls -l /sdcard/recording` and you should see your newly recorded file
   * Run `adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.vrs myLocalFolder/` to download the VRS file
   * Run `adb pull /sdcard/recording/myVrsFile.json myLocalFolder/` to download the VRS metadata
   * VRS files can be visualized using the [Aria Viewer](/docs/data_utilities/visualization_guide.mdx)

### Example 2: Start and stop recording using a custom sensor profile

Use [Project Aria Recording Profiles](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles) to choose among different sensor configurations. To set a specific profile, run:

```bash
python -m device_record --profile profile15
```

### Example 3: Start and stop recording over Wi-Fi
Recording over Wi-Fi is similar with Example 1, with a few extra steps.

1. Connect your Aria glasses and computer to the same compatible Wi-Fi network:
   * Check [Requirements](/docs/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx) for details about compatible routers
2. Open the Mobile Companion app and tap [Wi-Fi on the Dashboard](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#dashboard) to see your glasses' IP address
3. From the samples directory in Terminal, run:

```bash
python -m device_record --device-ip <Glasses IP>
```

Make sure you replace `<Glasses IP>` with the IP address you got from the Mobile Companion app

4. The recording LED will show on your Aria glasses
5. After 10 seconds the recording will stop and be stored in your Aria glasses. Follow the same step in Example 1 to pull the data to your computer

### Code walkthrough

#### 1. Retrieve RecordingManager instance

Use [RecordingManager](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference#ariasdkrecordingmanager) to start and stop a recording and get access to the calibration data.

```python
recording_manager = device.recording_manager
```

#### 2. Configure recording settings
Set the profile name for the recording in [RecordingConfig](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference#ariasdkrecordingconfig) or you'll use your glasses' [default recording profile](/docs/ARK/ARK_quickstart#set-your-default-recording-profile). If a default recording profile has not been set, you'll record with `profile8`. Go to the [Sensor Profiles page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/sdk_sensor_profiles) for supported profiles and their specs.

```python
recording_config = aria.RecordingConfig()
# If set, profile_name takes precedence over the default profile
recording_config.profile_name = args.profile_name
recording_manager.recording_config = recording_config
```

#### 3. Start recording for specific amount of time

```python
recording_manager.start_recording()
time.sleep(args.recording_duration)
recording_manager.stop_recording()
```

:::info
You can also stop recording using the Capture button on the glasses, Mobile Companion app or [CLI](/docs/ARK/sdk/cli/api_reference).
