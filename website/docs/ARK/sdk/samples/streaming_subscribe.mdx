# Subscribe to Aria Streaming Data

## Overview
This article shows you how to use the [Project Aria Client SDK](/docs/ARK/sdk) to live stream your Aria glasses' camera feed in two separate windows: one for the RGB camera and one for the SLAM cameras.

## Ways to stream and subscribe

### Example 1: Stream and subscribe over USB
In this example, the CLI is used to initiate streaming and the Client SDK is used to subscribe to the stream.

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer using the provided cable.
2. From the samples directory in Terminal<!--If we can eventually get a page/section that explains how to get to the samples directory on the three kinds of machines, then I'd love to link to that here-->, run:

```bash
aria streaming start --interface usb --use-ephemeral-certs
```

3. Wait for the stream to start, then run:

```bash
python -m streaming_subscribe
```

You should then see:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/streaming_subscribe.png')} alt="Aria Live Stream Window"/>
</div>

4. There are several ways you can stop streaming:
  * Press q or ESC to quit the app.
  * Use Ctrl-C to terminate in Terminal.
  * Press the Capture button on your glasses.

### Example 2: Stream and subscribe over Wi-Fi<!--I'm skipping this until I've had the chance to playtest the documentation at home-->

To use Wi-Fi to initiate streaming or to stream data, alter the `aria streaming start --interface usb --use-ephemeral-certs` command.

* To stream data over Wi-Fi, use `--interface wifi`
* To initiate streaming over Wi-Fi, add `--device-ip <glasses IP>`
  *  Open the Mobile Companion app and tap [Wi-Fi on the Dashboard](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#dashboard) to see your glasses' IP address


## Code walkthrough

### 1. Configure the subscription<!--These shouldn't have numbers unless they're meant to be done in a specific order-->
Use the `subscriber_data_type` attribute to set the type of data the client subscribes to.

```python
config = streaming_client.subscription_config
config.subscriber_data_type = (
    aria.StreamingDataType.Rgb | aria.StreamingDataType.Slam
)
```

### 2. Set message queue size
The message queue size determines how many recent frames will be retained. A smaller queue size is utilized to process only the most recent data.<!--I need to know what is meant by this. If the point being made is that smaller queue sizes should be used if the developer only wants to process recent data, then we should say "Use smaller queue sizes to process only the most recent data." It's more clear about its intent and avoids passive voice.-->

```python
config.message_queue_size[aria.StreamingDataType.Rgb] = 1
config.message_queue_size[aria.StreamingDataType.Slam] = 1
```

### 3. Set streaming security options
Security options are set to use ephemeral certificates through a `StreamingSecurityOptions` instance. <!--I need to know what exactly is meant by "Security options are set to use ephemeral certificates through a StreamingSecurityOptions instance." Does it mean that you use security options to enable ephemeral certificates if that's what you want? Does it mean that the code block below is showing how to set your security options to use ephemeral certificates? Does it mean that the default is for ephemeral certificates to be used, but you can use the code illustrated here to change that? I'm going to rewrite this section based on the answer, so it's something I'll need to know.-->See [Streaming Internals](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals) for various aspects of streaming security and how certificates are used.

```python
options = aria.StreamingSecurityOptions()
options.use_ephemeral_certs = True
config.security_options = options
```
### 4. Create a StreamingClient observer and attach it
You can learn more about observers in [this code sample](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/device_stream#4-write-callbacks-for-each-sensor-data-stream)<!--I've changed the link so that it works instead of producing an error, as it simply wasn't written correctly previously. That said, we should keep an eye on this one, as removing the 4 (as I may very well do when we reach it) would break this updated link. However, I can probably get around this by creating an anchor, which would lead to a more stable link. Also, while I acknowledge that "go here for more information is lazy," this is just a first pass. Feel free to provide feedback on what you'd want as context within this article.-->
```python
class StreamingClientObserver:
    def __init__(self):
        self.images = {}

    def on_image_received(self, image: np.array, record: ImageDataRecord):
        self.images[record.camera_id] = image

observer = StreamingClientObserver()
streaming_client.set_streaming_client_observer(observer)
```

### 5. Start subscribing and listen to the live stream
The client begins listening for incoming streaming data from the subscribed data types.<!--This section is written strangely. "Listening to" versus "listening for"? Is "Start subscribing" necessary? I don't know exactly what this is trying to say, so I'm not changing anything for now, but I'd like to talk to a SME about rephrasing it.-->

```python
streaming_client.subscribe()
```

### 6. Visualize the live stream
RGB and SLAM images are visualized in separate windows using OpenCV. The images are processed and displayed the streaming stops or the application quit. We rotate the image and stack the SLAM images so that they are shown in a single window.


```python
while not quit_keypress():
    # Render the RGB image
    if aria.CameraId.Rgb in observer.images:
        rgb_image = np.rot90(observer.images[aria.CameraId.Rgb], -1)
        rgb_image = cv2.cvtColor(rgb_image, cv2.COLOR_BGR2RGB)
        cv2.imshow(rgb_window, rgb_image)
        del observer.images[aria.CameraId.Rgb]

    # Stack and display the SLAM images
    if (
        aria.CameraId.Slam1 in observer.images
        and aria.CameraId.Slam2 in observer.images
    ):
        slam1_image = np.rot90(observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam1], -1)
        slam2_image = np.rot90(observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam2], -1)
        cv2.imshow(slam_window, np.hstack((slam1_image, slam2_image)))
        del observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam1]
        del observer.images[aria.CameraId.Slam2]
```


:::note
Cameras on Aria glasses are installed sideways. The visualizer rotates the raw image data for a more natural view.

### 7. Unsubscribe from the stream and free resources<!--Would "to free up resources" be better?-->
Unsubscribing stops the client from listening to streaming data and cleans up resources.<!--Would "and frees up resources" be better?-->

```python
streaming_client.unsubscribe()
```
