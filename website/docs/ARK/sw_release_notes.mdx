## Announcing Aria Research Kit v1.14 with 21 Landmark Hand Tracking in MPS
We are pleased to announce the release of Aria Research Kit v1.14 which now makes fully articulated 21 landmark hand joint positions available with Machine Perception Services Hand Tracking output as a new CSV file called hand_tracking_results.csv. Researchers can utilize this long-awaited feature to produce detailed 3D hand pose annotations useful for robotics research, contextual AI, and anywhere else that hand signals may be important.

![Hand tracking demonstration](/img/data_utilities/21-keypoint-tri.png)

In addition to 21 landmarks output, we output a six-degree-of-freedom transform at the wrist location to allow for transformation of the landmarks from the hand frame to the device frame, and normal vectors computed at both the wrist and palm landmarks. The transform and normals form a consistent system and the normals also match the normals we’ve computed on previous versions of wrist and palm output.

![The 21 landmarks](/img/data_utilities/21-keypoints.png)

We encourage hand tracking users to transition to this new output format, where we will be investing in any future maintenance and bug fixing. We will also continue to provide wrist_and_palm_poses output, which can be loaded with prior versions of projectaria_tools, but will not invest in bug fixes or feature additions for this legacy format.

* Here's a [Notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/core/examples/mps_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb) and [Sample Code (Python & C++)](../data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps.mdx#hand-tracking) demonstrating how to load and use the landmarks.

* See [Documentation](../data_formats/mps/hand_tracking/hand_tracking.mdx) on data format definitions.

**Reminder for Aria Desktop App Deprecation:** As mentioned in previous release notes, the Aria Desktop App will be fully deprecated on May 30th, 2025, at which point requests to MPS will not be possible and documentation for the tool will be removed. Please migrate over to [Aria Studio](aria_studio.mdx) if you haven’t already.

### Update your Software to Access These Improvements

#### Aria Companion App
Aria Mobile Companion App App v215 is now available for installation. Visit to the [ARK SW Downloads and Updates](ark_downloads.mdx) to download the latest version for Android. For iOS, select Update in the TestFlight app.

#### Project Aria Tools
The latest projectaria-tools 1.6.0 contains tooling necessary to load and visualize 21 landmark hand tracking output. See [documentation](../data_utilities/data_utilities.mdx) for download instructions.

## **Announcing Aria Research Kit v1.10**
October 9, 2024

We're announcing the release of Aria Research Kit v1.10. This release adds versioning to all of the Machine Perception Services and includes a major update to make the SLAM service more accurate for downstream tasks that utilize 3D results projected into the RGB camera frame. We are also making it much easier for you to visualize, edit, and prepare your Aria recordings for downstream use such as dataset preparation and model training with PyTorch.

### MPS Versioning

Starting now, we are introducing the concept of versioning to machine perception services. When we make changes to our SLAM, hand tracking, or eye tracking services, you will have information about which version of the service was utilized for your result computation. This will be available directly at the very end of the summary.json file. Versions will have a major, minor, and bugfix number (e.g. SLAM v1.1.0). We will keep our [MPS Service Versions page](/ARK/mps/mps_versioning.mdx) updated as we roll out new versions so that you are aware of the changes we make.

### RGB Online Calibration

Aria excels at enabling computer vision from a 3D perspective. Our SLAM Machine Perception Service provides Aria trajectory and a semi-dense point cloud output that allow computations in a 3D reference frame. Tasks like object detection can be performed in 3D and then be re-projected back into the 2D RGB images. Available as of v1.1.0, we’ve implemented extremely accurate RGB online calibration for all of your downstream tasks that utilize 3D results reprojected into the RGB camera frame. Read the [MPS Output Calibration page](/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_calibration.mdx) for more details on how to make use of online calibration.

### New Tools for Working with VRS

We know that it takes manual work to prepare Aria recordings for downstream use, so we’ve released some new tools to make things easier. We now provide a lightweight [VRS Player App](/data_formats/aria_vrs/aria_vrsplayer.mdx) that allows you to easily play the visual and audio sensor streams of a recording from a file menu or by using a simple command. We’ve also released a [VRS Command Line Tool](/data_formats/aria_vrs/aria_vrs_command_line.mdx) that enables easy inspection and editing of VRS files. For example, you can time crop a recording to eliminate an unwanted segment or remove sensor streams that you no longer need in your final dataset after processing through Machine Perception Services. Install both the lightweight VRS Player and the VRS Command Line Tool with the [VRS Tools Installer](/data_formats/aria_vrs/aria_vrs_tools_installation.mdx).

### Aria Training and Evaluation Toolkit

Preparing Aria recordings for training in PyTorch just got easier with Aria Training and Evaluation Kit (ATEK). ATEK offers an efficient solution to convert VRS files to PyTorch compatible formats, simplifying integration and use within deep learning projects. We’ve also pre-processed two popular Aria datasets with ATEK for direct usage in a data store. And lastly, we’ve created standardized evaluation libraries for 3D object detection and surface reconstruction. Read an in-depth [blog post on ATEK](https://www.projectaria.com/news/aria-training-and-evaluation-toolkit-atek/) for more information and see the [ATEK GitHub page](https://github.com/facebookresearch/ATEK/tree/main) to install ATEK today.

### Project Aria Now on Huggingface
Finally, we introduce the [Project Aria Huggingface Space](https://huggingface.co/projectaria), which allows researchers to track their model performance, helping measure, compare, and accelerate AI and ML research within the open community. AI models and datasets, released in the Project Aria Hugging Face space, will be supported by ATEK. Where possible, AI models trained using Project Aria data will also be available with full weights and scripts, making it easy for researchers to discover and benchmark existing models against their own methods.

### Aria Studio Updates

We've also made some updates to Aria Studio. We now display a version number and have a mechanism for surfacing updates and other key information that we want to communicate to our users. Today, Aria Studio is installed via pip install, and in doing so you'll automatically get these new features. If you haven't yet tried it, please install [Aria Studio](/ARK/aria_studio.mdx) today.

### Any Questions?

If you have any questions regarding this new functionality in Aria Research Kit v1.10 or any issues accessing any of the features, please reach out to our support team at AriaOps@meta.com.

### Wrist and Palm Tracking Updates in MPS
We’ve made some exciting updates to our wrist and palm tracking capabilities in our machine perception services (MPS). Starting now, all jobs launched will utilize these new features.

#### What’s New?
1. We’ve tuned our hand tracking algorithm to improve recall for common computer vision research use cases.
2. We are including normal vectors to the wrist and palm landmark output so that you can better understand the orientation of hands in your sequences ([see documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/hand_tracking) and [a notebook to visualize sample data](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/core/examples/mps_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb))
3. We provide a demonstration of how to project popular third-party hand tracking models onto our wrist and palm landmark output for tasks that require higher-fidelity hand tracking output ([see Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/tools/samples/python/mps_handtracking_overlay_media_pipe)).

#### What Do I Need to Update to Access It?
1. Follow [instructions in our Wiki](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/aria_studio#install-aria-studio-via-pypi) to re-install Aria Studio. This will update all necessary dependencies for you.
2. If you’re only using our CLI directly instead of Aria Studio, you can just update to Projectaria_tools 1.5.6 using `pip install projectaria_tools --upgrade`. This will be handled automatically if you update or re-install Aria Studio.

#### Any Questions?
If you have any issues accessing or using Live Preview or our new hand tracking functionality, please reach out to our support team at AriaOps@meta.com.

This new model’s output schema adds to `general_eye_gaze.csv` and `personalized_eye_gaze.csv` in a way that ensures backward compatibility with Project Aria Tools.

* [Eye Gaze Data Formats page](/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze.mdx) - schema has been updated
* [Eye Gaze Code Snippets](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/eye_gaze_code.mdx) - new page


#### Known Issues

* The new Eye Gaze model does not generate `yaw_rads_cpf` outputs
    * This value can be computed using [helper functions](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/eye_gaze_code.mdx#helper) and is automatically read when parsed with our data utilities.


#### Bug Fixes

Minor bug fixes

### Desktop Companion App v38

Download v38 on Windows or MacOS to request Hand Tracking MPS and to get bug fixes.

MPS requests using the Desktop app have been slightly restructured, you no longer need to request Point Cloud data as an additional service. The request options are:

* SLAM (6DoF Trajectory, Semi-Dense Point Cloud, Online Sensor Calibration)
* Eye Gaze (General, plus personalized if the VRS file contains In-Session Eye Gaze Calibration)
* Hand Tracking (Wrist and Palm Tracking)

The Streaming button in the dashboard has been renamed to Preview, to better reflect the capability provided by the Desktop app. Use the [Client SDK with CLI](/ARK/sdk/sdk.mdx) to stream data.

Desktop app logs are now stored in `~/.aria/logs/aria_desktop_app_{date}_{time}.log`

* Please note, the streaming preview available through the Desktop app is optimized for Profile 12.


#### Known Issues

* If you encounter the file too small error when requesting MPS, it may be because the Desktop app is in a bad state. Restarting the app should resolve this issue
* Selecting Cancel does not work when downloading MPS is in progress
* [MacOS] When the app is launched with logging enabled, the Aria icon might not appear in the taskbar, but functions should not be impacted
* [Windows] The Aria icon does not render correctly when pinned to the taskbar


#### Bug Fixes

* If starting recording/streaming fails the UI will now refresh
* Issue where you can’t request MPS unless you interact with tick boxes has been resolved
* Issue where the Desktop app did not quit completely on MacOS has been resolved


### Project Aria Tools v1.5

Project Aria Tools provides open tooling for anyone wanting to work with Aria data. For this release it enables users to request Hand Tracking data using the MPS CLI and provides a new ASR Python code sample.

Update Project Aria Tools:

* Python users: [Update projectaria_tools Python package](/data_utilities/installation/installation_python.mdx)
    * Install via Pip to be able to request Hand Tracking data using the MPS CLI
* C++ users: [Update projectaria_tools git repository](/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase.mdx)

### Aria Glasses OS

The latest Project Aria OS build **4968297.250.70** was released on March 11, 2024.


#### New recording profiles

We’ve released the following experimental recording profiles. If you use a new profile, we’d love to hear about how it works for you.

**Recording Profile 26:** Minimal sensors, low RGB frame rate for extended recording times. The aim is 5+ recording hours while having RGB camera data at a low frame rate (unlike Recording Profile 20, which has IMU, but no RGB data).

**Recording Profile 27**: Designed for streaming over USB.

**Recording Profile 28: **Very high Eye Tracking camera frame rate.

**Recording Profile 29:** Low RGB frame rate, JPEG with decimation. This recording profile is the same as Profile 26, however 9 out of every 10 JPEG frames are skipped (decimation/sub-sampling). This is our first recording profile that uses decimation. The data from the RGB data stream is saved at a rate that archives a frame rate of 0.1FPS. The aim of this profile is to be able to record for 15+ hours.

Update to the latest version of the OS to access these profiles. Your glasses’ OS should automatically update when connected to Wi-Fi and power. Go to [Updating OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) to manually trigger an update.

You can see more details about recording profiles in the Mobile Companion app:

1. Open the Mobile Companion App and select **New Recording Session**
2. Select the existing recording profile (or Choose Profile if you have not set a default recording profile)
3. Tap **More Info** in the top right corner
    * The More info link may be difficult to see, this will be fixed in a future version of the Mobile Companion app

Or go to [Recording Profiles](/tech_spec/recording_profiles.mdx) documentation in Project Aria Tools.


#### Known Issues

* The new recording profiles are experimental and may be tuned further in the future.


#### Bug Fixes

* Make sure your glasses’ OS is less than 2 months old, to make sure you have a fix for an issue that may cause sluggish behavior in your Aria glasses, difficulties updating the OS, streaming data and reduced upload times.
    * [Updating OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) includes troubleshooting steps if you have difficulties updating the OS.


### Mobile Companion App v155

Please keep in mind, you can’t initiate recordings through the Mobile app if your glasses’ OS is more than 2 months old. Please make sure you update your [glasses’ OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx).


#### Updated look and feel of the Mobile app

The Mobile Companion app has a fresh new look! As part of this:

* The Settings tab has been renamed Profile
* Device Settings can be opened by tapping the glasses icon under Paired Glasses

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="80%" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ARK/mobile_app_device_settings.png')} alt="Device Settings page from the Dashboard"/>
</div>


#### Known Issues

### Aria Research Kit Release Notes

#### Project Aria Client SDK with CLI

`projectaria_client_sdk` is a new Python package/client library that enables you to directly interact with your Project Aria glasses from a client machine. This enables you to stream Aria data and run MP algorithms on that data, in real-time.

The Client SDK currently offers the ability to:

* Connect and disconnect from the device via USB and WiFi
* Retrieve detailed device information and its current status
* Control Aria streaming and recording capabilities
* Access calibration data for the sensors you're recording with
* Subscribe and listen to Aria sensors data
* Visualize streaming data

A CLI, installed as part of the SDK, provides the ability to:

* Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
* Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
* Retrieve the device status and information
* Control Aria recording and streaming capabilities


To support this new feature, we’ve added a Client SDK section to ARK Documentation in Project Aria Tools, including:

* [Setup Guide](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk/setup)
* [Code Sample Examples and Walkthroughs](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk/samples)

#### New & Improved Machine Perception Service: Calibrated Eye Gaze

You can now generate Calibrated Eye Gaze MPS for sequences captured on Project Aria glasses that have in-session Eye Gaze Calibration. This enables you to capture more data about how Aria wearers look at objects, and improve the eye gaze estimations for any given recording.

When you request Eye Gaze Machine Perception Services (MPS) and the file has an in-session Eye Gaze Calibration as part of the VRS file, you will receive two outputs:

* `generalized_eye_gaze.csv` - based on the standard eye gaze configuration
* `calibrated_eye_gaze.csv` - calibrated eye gaze data based on the calibration data collected in the recording.

Additional improvements to Eye Gaze MPS include:

* `Summary.json` files are also now available for Eye Gaze MPS output
* We’ve created a new visualization tool, [MPS Replay Viewer (C++)](/docs/data_utilities/visualization/visualization_cpp#mps-3d-replay-visualizer),  to render static scene and dynamic elements.

See below for more details:

* [How to collect in-session eye gaze calibration data](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mps/eye_gaze_calibration)
* [Eye Gaze Data Format documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze) - updated to reflect new outputs

## **August Release - Project Aria Mobile App v125 is now available**
8/22/2023

Dear Academic Partners,

Download the Aria Mobile App v125 to ensure you have all the latest features and capabilities.  Sign into the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) on your Android device to download v125.



### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES

* Ability to name VRS files via the Mobile Companion app
* The default recording profile (if set via Mobile or Desktop app) will now also be the default profile when initiating recordings via the Mobile app
* Added a feature that requires the app to be updated if the app build is flagged as severely buggy.

#### Ability to name VRS files

Historically, the VRS files were given random alphanumeric names. This made the recordings difficult to distinguish from one another in the Desktop app and after downloading them. With this new release, the name given to a recording when creating a custom recording defines the VRS file name. You’ll get a warning if there are two recordings with the same name on your Aria device.



To access this feature:

1. In the mobile app, go to Settings to check that you have v125
   1. Sign into [portal.projectaria.com](https://portal.projectaria.com/home) on your phone to get the latest recommended build
2. Go to device settings (select the gear icon next to your glasses) to check that you have 4963656.310.70 of the OS
   1. Aria glasses will automatically update if they’re connected to Wi-Fi and power
   2. Select **Check for Updates** in Device Settings to make sure you have the most recent version of the OS



How to name a recording:

Set the recording’s name when you create a custom recording, or edit the file name of any recording on your glasses. To edit the name or to give an existing recording a name:

1. Go to the recording tab
2. Select a recording
3. Select **Edit** on the top right corner

#### Default recording profile applied to new recordings

With this change, the default recording profile selected for the glasses also applies to each recording started from the app. Previously, the default recording profile only applied to recordings started by the capture button on the glasses.



Please double-check that the correct profile is selected before you start each recording, as the behavior has changed. Previously, the app kept its own last-used setting; with this change, the default will flip back to the default recording profile of the glasses on connection. This default recording profile can be updated [via Device Settings](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#aria-device-settings) in the mobile app.

#### Disable severely buggy builds

This feature is a contingency plan, in case a severely broken app build is rolled out by mistake. In this situation, the app would show a full-screen dialog that requires it to be updated in order to proceed.

### BUG FIXES

Various bug fixes implemented to improve the overall usage of the App.



### PROJECT ARIA LATEST OS

The latest Project Aria OS build **4963656.310.70** was released on August 22, 2023.

## **July Release - new documentation site, Aria Desktop App v37 and Mobile App v120**
7/11/23

Dear Academic Partners,

With this July release we’re pleased to announce a new documentation site on GitHub, Desktop Companion App v37, and Aria Mobile Companion App v120.

V37 of the Desktop Companion App updates the app to the new Project Aria branding, the ability to run the Desktop app from the command line and users will now be able to request Semi-Dense Point Cloud MPS.

[_Project Aria Tools_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro) is our new documentation site on GitHub. Information that used to be at [projectaria.com](http://projectaria.com/) is now in the [_Aria Research Kit section_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/about_ARK)of the site and no login is required to access the documentation.

Download the updated companion apps from the [_Aria Web Portal_](https://portal.projectaria.com/). If you sign in on your desktop computer, you’ll get the Desktop Companion app. If you sign in on your Android mobile device, you’ll download the Mobile Companion app.

### NEW AND UPDATED FEATURES

### Documentation now on GitHub

The documentation previously hosted at projectaria.com will now be hosted in Project Aria Tools.

Project Aria Tools is the new comprehensive website for all your documentation needs. It contains over 60 pages, covering technical specifications, data formats, data utilities you can use with your data, information and tooling for open data we’ve released and technical insights for deeper dives.

The [_Aria Research Kit_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/about_ARK) section contains information specific to Academic partners who have access to Aria glasses and MPS. We’ve added a few extra pages and updated the documentation for this release, updates include adding:

* [_Get the Right Size Glasses_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/frame_sizing) - sizing information if you’re ordering glasses (our small is surprisingly large!)
* [_How to Join the Academic Partners Workplace Group_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/workplacegroup)
* [_Aria Glasses User Manual_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/glasses_manual/glasses_user_manual) - a combination of old and new information. Proper Handling and Cleaning information is now at the top.


There is a lot of new documentation to explore, including:

* [_Aria Data Utilities_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_utilities/getting_started) - including new Jupyter notebook tutorials
* [_More detailed information about recording profiles_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles) (scroll the table sideways to see all the columns)
* More [_data format information_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats) (including [_coordinate conventions_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/2d_image_coordinate_system_convention))
* New Open Datasets with tooling, [_Aria Digital Twin Dataset_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset) and [_Aria Synthetic Environments Dataset_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset).

### Desktop App v37 - Semi-dense point cloud

From V37 of the Desktop app onwards, users will be able to request semi-dense point clouds as an addition to trajectory MPS services. The same sensor profile requirements for generating trajectory data apply to semi-dense point cloud.

[_Semi-dense point clouds_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_pointcloud) are used by researchers who need static scene 3D reconstructions, reliable 2D images tracks or a representative visualization of the environment.


* [_About Aria Machine Perception Services (MPS)_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mps)
* _How to Request MPS_
* [_MPS Output - Semi-Dense Point Cloud_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_pointcloud)

### Improved UI & UX
* The Desktop app has been updated to match Aria’s new brand
* The recordings view has been revamped, users will now see a thumbnail for each recording and the upload ID can be copied
* The Desktop app can now be run directly from the command line without needing a GUI. It currently includes two utilities as subcommands:
   * Further documentation about how to run the Desktop app from the command line will be added to the ARK wiki soon
   * health: use this to run validity checks on an Aria recording (VRS file)
       * It can be run from the command line as follows: AriaHub health vrsFilePath.vrs
       * These checks are also run on the VRS file automatically, before the file gets uploaded for MPS processing. The results of those checks can be found under your home directory under  ./aria/logs
   * vrs: a Swiss army knife utility to manipulate VRS files in different ways
       * It can be run from the command line as follows: AriaHub vrs vrsFilePath.vrs
       * Go to VRS official documentation for a full list of commands


### Mobile App v120 - Quality Screens Feature update

Some additional features have been added to the quality screen feature that was introduced with v115. You’ll now be able to see timecodes and the overall score percentage for the sensors.


### BUG FIXES

Various bug fixes improving the overall usage of the Apps.


### PROJECT ARIA LATEST DEVICE OS

## **Aria Mobile App v115 is now available**
Dear Academic Partners,
The Aria Mobile App v115 for Android is now available for download from the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) (accessed via your Android internet browser).

### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES
* Sensor data quality signals
* In-Session personalized eye gaze calibration
* Differentiate paired glasses in the pairing screen
   * When you select **Add glasses**, the available Aria devices will be split into Paired Glasses and Other Glasses so that it’s easy to tell which glasses are already paired with the app.

#### Sensor Data Quality Signals
While making recordings, researchers will be able to see whether there are any sensor data quality issues (for example, due to thermal mitigation). To check for any issues, in the Mobile Companion app, view the "Sensor Status" section in the Recording Status Screen. Tap on the row to see full details. If you’ve initiated recording via the Capture button, access the Recording Status by selecting Recording in progress on the Mobile Companion app’s main dashboard.

#### In-Session Personalized Eye Gaze Calibration
Users will be able to record personalized eye gaze calibrations within an ongoing recording. The eye gaze calibration section of the sequence can be used to improve the eye gaze estimations in the rest of the recording. In the future, Machine Perception Services will be able to consume these recordings and output more accurate gaze information.

1. In the Mobile Companion app, create a new recording using a profile that includes ET and RGB cameras (such as Profile 15 or 25)
2. Once your recording has started, close the recording window
   * Select X on the top left of the screen
4. Go to Device Settings (select the gear next to your glasses)
5. Select Eye Tracking Calibration
6. Confirm that you’d like to run the during the current recording session
7. Follow the prompts to calibrate your glasses

#### Eye Gaze Calibration tips
##### Things to Avoid
❌ Do not wear a face covering during eye calibration.

❌ Choose an area with ample and even lighting; do not face a bright light, window or reflective surface.

❌ Do not set your phone screen brightness too high compared to your surroundings.

❌ Do not fully extend your arm(s) during eye calibration. Your elbows should be bent so that the phone is roughly 1 ft (30 cm) away from your face.

##### Helpful Tips
✅ The phone should be held straight in front of your face, so that you shouldn't look up or down to see the screen. Hold the phone plumb (90 degrees) vertically to the ground.

✅ The "Leveler" stage appears if the position of your phone isn't within specifications for the calibration process. Adjust the phone in front of you and its distance by bending your elbow until the smaller, black circle turns into a green disk with a check mark.

✅ Once the "Leveler" stage is successfully completed, do your best to keep your phone in exactly the same position throughout the full eye calibration process. If your phone is moved to a position no longer suited to calibrate your device, the app will return to the "Leveler" stage.

✅ The eye calibration stages 1 to 10 move your nose towards the direction indicated by the arrow. If you're only following the direction with your gaze without moving your head, the calibration stage will time out and fail. However, you make sure to keep your eyes fixed on the number within the dot the whole time.
