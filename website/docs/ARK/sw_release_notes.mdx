These SW Release notes are for the Aria Research Kit (ARK), and are for Meta SW that supports Academic Research Partners using Project Aria glasses. To find out how to become a research partner, go to [projectaria.com](https://projectaria.com).

Our Open Source Project Aria Tools SW Release notes are posted to [Project Aria Tools GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools), using Tags > Releases.

## Announcing Aria Research Kit v1.9

We're announcing a new release of Aria Research Kit v1.9, now including Live Preview in the Aria Companion App and updates to our Wrist and Palm tracking MPS output. Read below for more details!

Use our new feature, Live Preview, to visualize the RGB camera, SLAM camera, and eye tracking camera sensor streams directly in the Aria Companion App on your mobile device. Live Preview gives you a tighter feedback loop to ensure that you are recording the right data for your research activities.

With Live Preview, your glasses operate as a Wi-Fi hotspot, streaming the sensor data directly without the need for an external router.

### How to Use Live Preview
* Update your Companion App to v175 [(software download page)](ark_downloads.mdx)
* Update your glasses to the latest OS version using OTA updates.
* In the Dashboard tab, look for and tap the Live Preview button.

### Wrist and Palm Tracking Updates in MPS
We’ve made some exciting updates to our wrist and palm tracking capabilities in our machine perception services (MPS). Starting now, all jobs launched will utilize these new features.

#### What’s New?
1. We’ve tuned our hand tracking algorithm to improve recall for common computer vision research use cases.
2. We are including normal vectors to the wrist and palm keypoint output so that you can better understand the orientation of hands in your sequences ([see documentation](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/hand_tracking) and [a notebook to visualize sample data](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/core/examples/mps_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb))
3. We provide a demonstration of how to project popular third-party hand tracking models onto our wrist and palm keypoint output for tasks that require higher-fidelity hand tracking output ([see Jupyter notebook](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/tools/samples/python/mps_handtracking_overlay_media_pipe)).

#### What Do I Need to Update to Access It?
1. Follow [instructions in our Wiki](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/aria_studio#install-aria-studio-via-pypi) to re-install Aria Studio. This will update all necessary dependencies for you.
2. If you’re only using our CLI directly instead of Aria Studio, you can just update to Projectaria_tools 1.5.4 using `pip install projectaria_tools --upgrade`. This will be handled automatically if you update or re-install Aria Studio.

#### Any Questions?
If you have any issues accessing or using Live Preview or our new hand tracking functionality, please reach out to our support team at AriaOps@meta.com.

#### Update to Eye Gaze outputs - depth estimations

We have introduced a new model for computing eye gaze, which produces left and right eye gaze directions along with the depth at which these gaze directions intersect.

This new model’s output schema adds to `general_eye_gaze.csv` and `personalized_eye_gaze.csv` in a way that ensures backward compatibility with Project Aria Tools.

* [Eye Gaze Data Formats page](/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze.mdx) - schema has been updated
* [Eye Gaze Code Snippets](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/eye_gaze_code.mdx) - new page


#### Known Issues

* The new Eye Gaze model does not generate `yaw_rads_cpf` outputs
    * This value can be computed using [helper functions](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/eye_gaze_code.mdx#helper) and is automatically read when parsed with our data utilities.


#### Bug Fixes

Minor bug fixes

### Desktop Companion App v38

Download v38 on Windows or MacOS to request Hand Tracking MPS and to get bug fixes.

MPS requests using the Desktop app have been slightly restructured, you no longer need to request Point Cloud data as an additional service. The request options are:

* SLAM (6DoF Trajectory, Semi-Dense Point Cloud, Online Sensor Calibration)
* Eye Gaze (General, plus personalized if the VRS file contains In-Session Eye Gaze Calibration)
* Hand Tracking (Wrist and Palm Tracking)

The Streaming button in the dashboard has been renamed to Preview, to better reflect the capability provided by the Desktop app. Use the [Client SDK with CLI](/ARK/sdk/sdk.mdx) to stream data.

Desktop app logs are now stored in ~/.aria/logs/aria_desktop_app_{date}_{time}.log

* Please note, the streaming preview available through the Desktop app is optimized for Profile 12.


#### Known Issues

* If you encounter the file too small error when requesting MPS, it may be because the Desktop app is in a bad state. Restarting the app should resolve this issue
* Selecting Cancel does not work when downloading MPS is in progress
* [MacOS] When the app is launched with logging enabled, the Aria icon might not appear in the taskbar, but functions should not be impacted
* [Windows] The Aria icon does not render correctly when pinned to the taskbar


#### Bug Fixes

* If starting recording/streaming fails the UI will now refresh
* Issue where you can’t request MPS unless you interact with tick boxes has been resolved
* Issue where the Desktop app did not quit completely on MacOS has been resolved


### Project Aria Tools v1.5

Project Aria Tools provides open tooling for anyone wanting to work with Aria data. For this release it enables users to request Hand Tracking data using the MPS CLI and provides a new ASR Python code sample.

Update Project Aria Tools:

* Python users: [Update projectaria_tools Python package](/data_utilities/installation/installation_python.mdx)
    * Install via Pip to be able to request Hand Tracking data using the MPS CLI
* C++ users: [Update projectaria_tools git repository](/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase.mdx)

Go to [https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/releases/tag/1.5.3](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/releases/tag/1.5.3) for the full release log.


#### Speech to Text Code Sample (Python)

This new ASR Python code sample shows how to use [Faster Whisper](https://github.com/SYSTRAN/faster-whisper) to run Whisper Speech Recognition on an Aria audio stream. The ASR outputs are time aligned with [Aria Device Time](/data_formats/aria_vrs/timestamps_in_aria_vrs.mdx#vrs-timestamps-single-device).

Go to the [Automated Speech Recognition Readme](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/tools/samples/python/automated_speech_recognition/Readme.md) for how to get started.

![Speech to Text outputs](/img/data_utilities/asr_speech_to_text.png)


### Aria Glasses OS

The latest Project Aria OS build **4968297.250.70** was released on March 11, 2024.


#### New recording profiles

We’ve released the following experimental recording profiles. If you use a new profile, we’d love to hear about how it works for you.

**Recording Profile 26:** Minimal sensors, low RGB frame rate for extended recording times. The aim is 5+ recording hours while having RGB camera data at a low frame rate (unlike Recording Profile 20, which has IMU, but no RGB data).

**Recording Profile 27**: Designed for streaming over USB.

**Recording Profile 28: **Very high Eye Tracking camera frame rate.

**Recording Profile 29:** Low RGB frame rate, JPEG with decimation. This recording profile is the same as Profile 26, however 9 out of every 10 JPEG frames are skipped (decimation/sub-sampling). This is our first recording profile that uses decimation. The data from the RGB data stream is saved at a rate that archives a frame rate of 0.1FPS. The aim of this profile is to be able to record for 15+ hours.

Update to the latest version of the OS to access these profiles. Your glasses’ OS should automatically update when connected to Wi-Fi and power. Go to [Updating OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) to manually trigger an update.

You can see more details about recording profiles in the Mobile Companion app:

1. Open the Mobile Companion App and select **New Recording Session**
2. Select the existing recording profile (or Choose Profile if you have not set a default recording profile)
3. Tap **More Info** in the top right corner
    * The More info link may be difficult to see, this will be fixed in a future version of the Mobile Companion app

Or go to [Recording Profiles](/tech_spec/recording_profiles.mdx) documentation in Project Aria Tools.


#### Known Issues

* The new recording profiles are experimental and may be tuned further in the future.


#### Bug Fixes

* Make sure your glasses’ OS is less than 2 months old, to make sure you have a fix for an issue that may cause sluggish behavior in your Aria glasses, difficulties updating the OS, streaming data and reduced upload times.
    * [Updating OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx) includes troubleshooting steps if you have difficulties updating the OS.


### Mobile Companion App v155

Please keep in mind, you can’t initiate recordings through the Mobile app if your glasses’ OS is more than 2 months old. Please make sure you update your [glasses’ OS](/ARK/troubleshooting/update_glasses_os.mdx).


#### Updated look and feel of the Mobile app

The Mobile Companion app has a fresh new look! As part of this:

* The Settings tab has been renamed Profile
* Device Settings can be opened by tapping the glasses icon under Paired Glasses

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="80%" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ARK/mobile_app_device_settings.png')} alt="Device Settings page from the Dashboard"/>

`projectaria_client_sdk` is a new Python package/client library that enables you to directly interact with your Project Aria glasses from a client machine. This enables you to stream Aria data and run MP algorithms on that data, in real-time.

The Client SDK currently offers the ability to:

* Connect and disconnect from the device via USB and WiFi
* Retrieve detailed device information and its current status
* Control Aria streaming and recording capabilities
* Access calibration data for the sensors you're recording with
* Subscribe and listen to Aria sensors data
* Visualize streaming data

A CLI, installed as part of the SDK, provides the ability to:

* Pair the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
* Connect to the glasses via USB or Wi-Fi
* Retrieve the device status and information
* Control Aria recording and streaming capabilities


To support this new feature, we’ve added a Client SDK section to ARK Documentation in Project Aria Tools, including:

* [Project Aria Client SDK](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk)
* [Setup Guide](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk/setup)
* [Code Sample Examples and Walkthroughs](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/sdk/samples)

#### New & Improved Machine Perception Service: Calibrated Eye Gaze

You can now generate Calibrated Eye Gaze MPS for sequences captured on Project Aria glasses that have in-session Eye Gaze Calibration. This enables you to capture more data about how Aria wearers look at objects, and improve the eye gaze estimations for any given recording.

When you request Eye Gaze Machine Perception Services (MPS) and the file has an in-session Eye Gaze Calibration as part of the VRS file, you will receive two outputs:

* `generalized_eye_gaze.csv` - based on the standard eye gaze configuration
* `calibrated_eye_gaze.csv` - calibrated eye gaze data based on the calibration data collected in the recording.

## **August Release - Project Aria Mobile App v125 is now available**
8/22/2023

Dear Academic Partners,

Download the Aria Mobile App v125 to ensure you have all the latest features and capabilities.  Sign into the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) on your Android device to download v125.



### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES

* Ability to name VRS files via the Mobile Companion app
* The default recording profile (if set via Mobile or Desktop app) will now also be the default profile when initiating recordings via the Mobile app
* Added a feature that requires the app to be updated if the app build is flagged as severely buggy.

#### Ability to name VRS files

Historically, the VRS files were given random alphanumeric names. This made the recordings difficult to distinguish from one another in the Desktop app and after downloading them. With this new release, the name given to a recording when creating a custom recording defines the VRS file name. You’ll get a warning if there are two recordings with the same name on your Aria device.



To access this feature:

1. In the mobile app, go to Settings to check that you have v125
   1. Sign into [portal.projectaria.com](https://portal.projectaria.com/home) on your phone to get the latest recommended build
2. Go to device settings (select the gear icon next to your glasses) to check that you have 4963656.310.70 of the OS
   1. Aria glasses will automatically update if they’re connected to Wi-Fi and power
   2. Select **Check for Updates** in Device Settings to make sure you have the most recent version of the OS



How to name a recording:

Set the recording’s name when you create a custom recording, or edit the file name of any recording on your glasses. To edit the name or to give an existing recording a name:

1. Go to the recording tab
2. Select a recording
3. Select **Edit** on the top right corner

#### Default recording profile applied to new recordings

With this change, the default recording profile selected for the glasses also applies to each recording started from the app. Previously, the default recording profile only applied to recordings started by the capture button on the glasses.



Please double-check that the correct profile is selected before you start each recording, as the behavior has changed. Previously, the app kept its own last-used setting; with this change, the default will flip back to the default recording profile of the glasses on connection. This default recording profile can be updated [via Device Settings](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#aria-device-settings) in the mobile app.

#### Disable severely buggy builds

This feature is a contingency plan, in case a severely broken app build is rolled out by mistake. In this situation, the app would show a full-screen dialog that requires it to be updated in order to proceed.

### BUG FIXES

Various bug fixes implemented to improve the overall usage of the App.



### PROJECT ARIA LATEST OS

The latest Project Aria OS build **4963656.310.70** was released on August 22, 2023.

## **July Release - new documentation site, Aria Desktop App v37 and Mobile App v120**
7/11/23

Dear Academic Partners,

With this July release we’re pleased to announce a new documentation site on GitHub, Desktop Companion App v37, and Aria Mobile Companion App v120.

V37 of the Desktop Companion App updates the app to the new Project Aria branding, the ability to run the Desktop app from the command line and users will now be able to request Semi-Dense Point Cloud MPS.

[_Project Aria Tools_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/intro) is our new documentation site on GitHub. Information that used to be at [projectaria.com](http://projectaria.com/) is now in the [_Aria Research Kit section_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/about_ARK)of the site and no login is required to access the documentation.

Download the updated companion apps from the [_Aria Web Portal_](https://portal.projectaria.com/). If you sign in on your desktop computer, you’ll get the Desktop Companion app. If you sign in on your Android mobile device, you’ll download the Mobile Companion app.

### NEW AND UPDATED FEATURES

### Documentation now on GitHub

The documentation previously hosted at projectaria.com will now be hosted in Project Aria Tools.

Project Aria Tools is the new comprehensive website for all your documentation needs. It contains over 60 pages, covering technical specifications, data formats, data utilities you can use with your data, information and tooling for open data we’ve released and technical insights for deeper dives.

The [_Aria Research Kit_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/about_ARK) section contains information specific to Academic partners who have access to Aria glasses and MPS. We’ve added a few extra pages and updated the documentation for this release, updates include adding:

* [_Get the Right Size Glasses_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/frame_sizing) - sizing information if you’re ordering glasses (our small is surprisingly large!)
* [_How to Join the Academic Partners Workplace Group_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/workplacegroup)
* [_Aria Glasses User Manual_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/glasses_manual/glasses_user_manual) - a combination of old and new information. Proper Handling and Cleaning information is now at the top.


There is a lot of new documentation to explore, including:

* [_Aria Data Utilities_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_utilities/getting_started) - including new Jupyter notebook tutorials
* [_More detailed information about recording profiles_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles) (scroll the table sideways to see all the columns)
* More [_data format information_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats) (including [_coordinate conventions_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/2d_image_coordinate_system_convention))
* New Open Datasets with tooling, [_Aria Digital Twin Dataset_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset) and [_Aria Synthetic Environments Dataset_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset).

### Desktop App v37 - Semi-dense point cloud

From V37 of the Desktop app onwards, users will be able to request semi-dense point clouds as an addition to trajectory MPS services. The same sensor profile requirements for generating trajectory data apply to semi-dense point cloud.

[_Semi-dense point clouds_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_pointcloud) are used by researchers who need static scene 3D reconstructions, reliable 2D images tracks or a representative visualization of the environment.


* [_About Aria Machine Perception Services (MPS)_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/ARK/mps)
* [_How to Request MPS_](/ARK/mps/request_mps/desktop_mps.mdx)
* [_MPS Output - Semi-Dense Point Cloud_](https://facebookresearch.github.io/projectaria_tools/docs/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_pointcloud)

### Improved UI & UX
* The Desktop app has been updated to match Aria’s new brand
* The recordings view has been revamped, users will now see a thumbnail for each recording and the upload ID can be copied
* The Desktop app can now be run directly from the command line without needing a GUI. It currently includes two utilities as subcommands:
   * Further documentation about how to run the Desktop app from the command line will be added to the ARK wiki soon
   * health: use this to run validity checks on an Aria recording (VRS file)
       * It can be run from the command line as follows: AriaHub health vrsFilePath.vrs
       * These checks are also run on the VRS file automatically, before the file gets uploaded for MPS processing. The results of those checks can be found under your home directory under  ./aria/logs
   * vrs: a Swiss army knife utility to manipulate VRS files in different ways
       * It can be run from the command line as follows: AriaHub vrs vrsFilePath.vrs
       * Go to VRS official documentation for a full list of commands


### Mobile App v120 - Quality Screens Feature update

Some additional features have been added to the quality screen feature that was introduced with v115. You’ll now be able to see timecodes and the overall score percentage for the sensors.


### BUG FIXES

Various bug fixes improving the overall usage of the Apps.

<br/>

## **Aria Mobile App v115 is now available**
Dear Academic Partners,
The Aria Mobile App v115 for Android is now available for download from the [Aria Web Portal](https://portal.projectaria.com) (accessed via your Android internet browser).

### NEW & UPDATED FEATURES
* Sensor data quality signals
* In-Session personalized eye gaze calibration
* Differentiate paired glasses in the pairing screen
   * When you select **Add glasses**, the available Aria devices will be split into Paired Glasses and Other Glasses so that it’s easy to tell which glasses are already paired with the app.

#### Sensor Data Quality Signals
While making recordings, researchers will be able to see whether there are any sensor data quality issues (for example, due to thermal mitigation). To check for any issues, in the Mobile Companion app, view the "Sensor Status" section in the Recording Status Screen. Tap on the row to see full details. If you’ve initiated recording via the Capture button, access the Recording Status by selecting Recording in progress on the Mobile Companion app’s main dashboard.

#### In-Session Personalized Eye Gaze Calibration
Users will be able to record personalized eye gaze calibrations within an ongoing recording. The eye gaze calibration section of the sequence can be used to improve the eye gaze estimations in the rest of the recording. In the future, Machine Perception Services will be able to consume these recordings and output more accurate gaze information.

1. In the Mobile Companion app, create a new recording using a profile that includes ET and RGB cameras (such as Profile 15 or 25)
2. Once your recording has started, close the recording window
   * Select X on the top left of the screen
4. Go to Device Settings (select the gear next to your glasses)
5. Select Eye Tracking Calibration
6. Confirm that you’d like to run the during the current recording session
7. Follow the prompts to calibrate your glasses

#### Eye Gaze Calibration tips
##### Things to Avoid
❌ Do not wear a face covering during eye calibration.

❌ Choose an area with ample and even lighting; do not face a bright light, window or reflective surface.

❌ Do not set your phone screen brightness too high compared to your surroundings.

❌ Do not fully extend your arm(s) during eye calibration. Your elbows should be bent so that the phone is roughly 1 ft (30 cm) away from your face.

##### Helpful Tips
✅ The phone should be held straight in front of your face, so that you shouldn't look up or down to see the screen. Hold the phone plumb (90 degrees) vertically to the ground.

✅ The "Leveler" stage appears if the position of your phone isn't within specifications for the calibration process. Adjust the phone in front of you and its distance by bending your elbow until the smaller, black circle turns into a green disk with a check mark.

✅ Once the "Leveler" stage is successfully completed, do your best to keep your phone in exactly the same position throughout the full eye calibration process. If your phone is moved to a position no longer suited to calibrate your device, the app will return to the "Leveler" stage.

✅ The eye calibration stages 1 to 10 move your nose towards the direction indicated by the arrow. If you're only following the direction with your gaze without moving your head, the calibration stage will time out and fail. However, you make sure to keep your eyes fixed on the number within the dot the whole time.

Dear Academic Partners,The Android Aria App v85 has now been released. Here is what you need to know.### NEW FEATURES AND IMPROVEMENTS

* If the Bluetooth and/or Location services need to be enabled, the app will now show a prompt to do so upon launching the app.
* During an ongoing recording, the Profile and Sensors used are now mentioned on the active recording page.

* The Android app will now show a banner on top of the screen indicating that the user has not selected a default Profile for the paired Project Aria device, which can only be done via the Desktop app.

### IF YOUR CURRENT VERSION IS V80
As long as you're currently using v80 (check the app version in the app Settings page), launching the app should trigger a notification prompting you to download the latest version from the [Partner Portal](https://projectaria.com).

### IF YOUR CURRENT VERSION IS OLDER THAN V80
App versions older than v80 will not receive any notifications, as this is a new feature (as announced in this [post](https://my.workplace.com/groups/1137227200340269/permalink/1193407851388870/)). In this case, you will need to uninstall the app and install v85 from the [Partner Portal](https://projectaria.com).

### WHAT IF YOU DISMISSED THE PROMPT?
If you dismissed the notification prompting you to update, it should appear again when you launch the Android Aria App the following day. If you don't want to wait that long, you can directly install the latest version from the [Partner Portal](https://projectaria.com).

### VERIFY V85 WAS INSTALLED
Once the Aria app is installed, login and tap the Settings tab at the bottom right corner of the Dashboard page. On that Settings page, you'll find the app version.
