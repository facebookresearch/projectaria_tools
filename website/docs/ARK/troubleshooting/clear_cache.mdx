# How to Clear the Desktop App's Cache

## Overview

This page provides information about how to clear the Desktop App's cache. Users may wish to do this if they're encountering issues signing into the app, experiencing instabilities in the app or are directed to do so by User Support to resolve an issue.

Please note, clearing the cache will clear all your history in VRS Tools, so you will no longer be able to download previously generated MPS.

Use the following commands to clear the cache.

## MacOS
```
rm -f /Users/unixname/Library/Preferences/com.meta.Aria.plist && killall -u unixname cfprefsd
```
## Windows

```
Remove-Item -Path 'HKCU:\SOFTWARE\Meta\Aria\'
```
Or open the Registry Editor and go to HKEY_CURRENT_USER->SOFTWARE->Meta then delete `Aria`

## Linux

```
rm -f /home/unixname/.config/Meta/Aria.conf
```
