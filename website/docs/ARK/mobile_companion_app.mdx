## Mobile Companion App Screens

### Recordings menu

In the Recordings menu, you'll be able to see recordings that are currently on your Aria glasses.

Select a recording in the Recording menu to edit your recording's name and notes (notes will be stored in the vrs.json file) and see a range of details including:

* Recording duration
* Recording profile used
* Up to 10 thumbnail images from your recording

If you have not given your recording a name (such as when you initiate recording via the capture button) the VRS file will have a random alphanumeric name when it is downloaded.

To name or edit the name of a VRS recording on your glasses:

1. Go to the recordings tab of the Mobile app
2. Select a recording
3. Select **Edit** on the top right corner


### Settings menu

The Settings menu shows the settings for the Aria app, not your Aria glasses. You'll be able to see the App version, but not the Aria glasses version.

In the Advanced Settings menu there is the option to Clear Local Data, which can be helpful if you encounter issues that restarting your Mobile App does not resolve. Aria recordings are stored on the glasses, not on the phone, so it will not delete any of your recordings.

On the main Aria Dashboard in the Mobile app, select the settings (gear) icon next to your Aria glasses to view your Aria glasses' settings.
