# Aria Glasses Fit and Comfort

## Overview
There are a few adjustments you can make to your Project Aria glasses to get a more comfortable fit.

## Ideal Fit

* **Proper frame width:** The device should match the overall width of your head. When too small, the device will be compressing on the sides of your head creating marks. When too large, the temple arms will feel too loose and not secure.
* **Proper nose pad fit**: The device should rest comfortably on your nose without slipping down or causing marks. The Nose pad bracket can be adjusted for proper angle and pad placement.
* **Proper temple arm fit**: Temple arms reach all the way behind your ears and flex adjusted to fit.

**Your frames should align evenly with your eyes**, no higher than your eyebrows. For eye-tracking, ensure that your eyes (pupils) are approximately located in between the dotted lines as shown in the picture.

## Nose Pad Adjustments

### The nose pads feel too tight or pinching on the nose?
**Solution:** Move pads further apart

1. Securing the frame eye wire with your hands, use your thumbs to spread the pad apart carefully. Make small incremental adjustments until desired fit is achieved.
2. Using your fingers, you can make small incremental adjustments on the pad angle by moving/turning the pad arm carefully.

An ideal fit is achieved by making sure the full surface of the soft nose pad is evenly placed on each side of your nose bridge.

### Nose pads are sitting too low on the nose, or feel loose?
 **Solution:** Move pads closer to each other

1. Use your thumbs to push the nose pads closer together until they fit snugly against either side of your nose, being careful to not damage the Device. Make small incremental adjustments until desired fit is achieved.
2. Using your fingers, you can make small incremental adjustments on the pad angle by moving/turning the pad arm carefully.
3. An ideal fit is achieved by making sure the full surface of the soft nose pad is evenly placed on each side of your nose bridge.

## Flexible Temple Arm Tips

**IMPORTANT! The flexible temple arm tips are restricted to horizontal inward/outward movement only. DO NOT move them vertically up or down.**

The ends of Project Aria Device arms are flexible, allowing you to make small adjustments to increase wearing comfort. Using your hands, you can bend the tips inward to make it tighter behind the ears or outward to make it looser.

## Ear Hooks

You can install Ear Hooks at the end of each temple arm tip, for a more secure and stable grip behind the ears.
