# Project Aria Glasses Recording Profile Guide

## Overview

This page provides an overview of Project Aria sensor recording profiles that are commonly used when collecting data with Project Aria glasses, as well as the recording profiles that work with Machine Perception Services (MPS).

Recording profiles enable researchers choosing which sensors to record with as well as what settings to use. Settings options include what camera resolution to use and whether the output is RAW (no encoding) or JPEG (compressed).

Go to [Recording Profiles](/tech_spec/recording_profiles.mdx) in Technical Specifications for more detailed information about each profile. Or, if you have a Project Aria glasses:

1. Open the Mobile Companion App and select **New Recording Session**
2. Select the existing recording profile (or **Choose Profile** if you have not set a default recording profile)
3. Select **More Info** in the top right corner


## General Guidance

These are some sensor profiles researchers have found useful for particular kinds of research. Check recording profiles on your Mobile Companion App for more details.

### If you’re not sure what you want

Profile 10 is interesting to explore, it gathers data with all sensors and the RGB Camera records at 10 fps. All sensor data is useful for exploring multimodal ML models.

If you need high RGB Resolution (2880x2880 rather than 1408x1408), and 1FPS is sufficient shutter speed, use Profile 0.

### If you're streaming data

While you can use any recording profile when streaming, we recommend only using Profiles 12 and 18, which are optimized for streaming.

### If you need a high frame rate

Use profiles 2, 9 or 15, depending on whether you want EyeTracking or GPS. Profile 2 does not have ET, profile 15 does not have GPS.

### If your research focuses on audio

Try profiles 4, 7 (no SLAM) or profile 10.

### To avoid image pre-processing

In situations where you want to use RAW videos and skip the Image Sensor Processor (ISP) as much as possible, profile 7 is helpful.

Please note, because profile 7 delivers RAW image files, not JPEGs the data is 8x more costly to store. This profile also uses more energy while recording and may heat up faster than others.

### Long duration recordings

Profiles 20 and 26 are optimized for 5+ recording hours. Profile 29 is optimized for recording times over 15 hours and uses JPEG decimation to provide 0.1FPS RGB data.

## Recording Profiles That Support MPS

The table below shows which recording profiles have the necessary data to generate Trajectory or Eye Gaze data using MPS. More commonly used profiles are marked with bold text.
