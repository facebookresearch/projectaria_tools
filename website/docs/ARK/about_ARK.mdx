# Aria Research Kit

The Aria Research Kit (ARK) provides Project Aria glasses, services and tools to enable researchers to gather and process their own Aria data. Go to [Aria Research Kit intro page](https://www.projectaria.com/research-kit/) at [projectaria.com](https://www.projectaria.com/) to find out more, or to apply to become a research partner.

The ARK provides a very flexible system capable of a variety of configurations. You may only need several of the components offered in the kit, or you may need the entire kit, depending on your research.

If your main objective is dataset development, you might require several sets of Aria glasses for collection, the Mobile Companion App for management of the device, and Machine Perception Services (MPS) for processing of the data. [Project Aria Tools](/data_utilities/data_utilities.mdx), part of our OSI offering, provides helpful data utilities and APIs for consuming and visualizing the data.

If your main objective is prototyping a streaming application, you may need Aria glasses, the Mobile Companion App for management of the device, and the Client SDK to stream and subscribe to data on your local machine.

If you encounter any issues, have feedback or questions, go to our [Support page](/support.mdx) for multiple ways to get in touch!


## Just received Project Aria glasses?

* The [Quickstart Guide](/ARK/ARK_quickstart.mdx) shows how to set up your glasses and make recordings
* The [Glasses User Manual](/ARK/glasses_manual/glasses_user_manual.mdx) provides a range of information, including how to factory reset your glasses


## Need to record data?

Follow the steps in the [Quickstart Guide](/ARK/ARK_quickstart.mdx) to set up your glasses, make and download recordings.

### Additional recording capabilities

* If you wish to get personalized Eye Gaze MPS outputs, perform [In-Session Eye Gaze Calibration](/ARK/mps/eye_gaze_calibration.mdx) at the start of each recording
* If you wish to create time synchronized recordings between multiple Aria glasses, use the [Client SDK to enable TICSync recordings](/ARK/sdk/ticsync.mdx)

### Processing and using the data

* Use [Aria Studio](aria_studio.mdx), the [MPS CLI](mps/request_mps/mps_cli.mdx) or the [Desktop Companion app](mps/request_mps/desktop_mps.mdx) to request MPS derived data outputs
* Use [Project Aria Tools](/data_utilities/data_utilities.mdx) to:
    * Make VRS data easier to consume by downstream applications without needing to convert to another file format
    * Visualize the data
    * Export VRS files to MP4, to facilitate reviews

## Need to stream data?

Set up your glasses as outlined in the [Quickstart Guide](/ARK/ARK_quickstart.mdx) and then install the [Client SDK](/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx).
