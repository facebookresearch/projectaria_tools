# MPS Hand Tracking Algorithm Performance Benchmark

This page presents the performance evaluation of the MPS Hand Tracking algorithm for Aria Gen1 glasses.

## Benchmark Dataset

3D evaluation is conducted on the **HOT3D Aria split**, a publicly available dataset for hand-object interaction research.

- **Dataset**: [HOT3D](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/hot3D/)
- **Total Duration**: 400 minutes of Aria Gen1 recordings
- **Number of Participants**: 19
- **Ground Truth Source**: Motion Capture (MoCap)

## Evaluation Metrics

We report the following metrics (lower is better for both):

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **LTR** (Lose Track Ratio) | The ratio of frames where the hand is not tracked successfully. |
| **MKPE** (Mean Keypoint Error) | The mean 3D distance error over all hand keypoints and all frames, measured in millimeters. |

## Results

| MPS HT Version | LTR (%) ↓ | MKPE (mm) ↓ |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| MPS HT 2.0.0 | 6.31 | 51.97 |
| **MPS HT 3.0.0** | **3.94** | **22.80** |


## About HOT3D Dataset

HOT3D is a large-scale dataset for egocentric hand and object tracking in 3D. The Aria split of HOT3D provides diverse hand-object interaction scenarios captured with Aria Gen1 glasses, making it an ideal benchmark for evaluating hand tracking algorithms in real-world conditions.
