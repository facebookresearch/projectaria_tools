## Overview

The versioning system for MPS services adheres to the following format:
1. **Major Number**: Indicates significant changes that are not backward compatible. This number is incremented when there are major updates or changes in the API that could affect existing functionalities.
2. **Minor Number**: Represents minor updates or improvements that are backward compatible. This number is incremented when additional features or minor improvements are introduced.
3. **Bugfix Number**: Used for small fixes and patches to address issues without affecting the overall functionality. This number is incremented when bugs are fixed.
