# Aria Studio

## Overview

Aria Studio is part of the [Aria Research Kit](about_ARK.mdx). The application will launch in your default web-browser and provides the ability to:

* Examine preview thumbnails and metadata of Aria recordings (on device or stored locally)
* Transfer recordings from the device to the local computer or delete recordings stored on the device or local computer
* Visualize recordings
    * We show visualizations of all the sensor streams except for audio. Audio outputs are not supported at this time.
* Group recordings for multi-sequence processing jobs
    * Grouped recordings are a special feature unlocked by Aria Studio. Users can group VRS recordings from anywhere in their directory for organizational purposes, or to request Multi-SLAM outputs.
    * Groups are stored on your local machine and associated with your Aria user account
* Request and manage Machine Perception Services (MPS) requests

Aria Studio can be installed on:

* x64 Linux distributions of:
    * Fedora 36, 37, 38
    * Ubuntu jammy (22.04 LTS) and focal (20.04 LTS)
* Mac Intel or Mac ARM-based (M1) with MacOS 11 (Big Sur) or newer

Python requirements:
* Linux - Python 3.8-3.11
* MacOS, Intel chip - Python 3.9-3.11
* MacOS, [Apple Silicon](https://support.apple.com/en-us/116943) - Python 3.10-3.11

Aria Studio is supported on Google Chrome.


## Machine Perception Services (MPS) capabilities

* Request MPS processing for recordings
    * SLAM, Eye Gaze and Hand Tracking for individual recordings
    * Multi-SLAM available for grouped recordings
* View MPS request history and status of current requests
* Access MPS CLI capabilities through a graphical user interface, such as:
    * Resumable uploads
    * MPS outputs automatically download (as long as Aria Studio is running)
    * Ability to submit multiple MPS requests at the same time

Like the MPS CLI, you can have granular control over settings such as uploads and download speeds by customizing `$HOME/.projectaria/mps.ini`. Go to the [MPS CLI Guide](/ARK/mps/request_mps/mps_cli_guide.mdx#cli-settings) for details about all the settings.


## Install Aria Studio via PyPi

### Create a virtual environment

When using PyPi’s `pip` command, it is best practice to use a virtual environment. This will keep all the modules under one folder and will not break your local environment. Use the following command with your version of Python3.

```
rm -rf $HOME/aria_studio # this removes any previous version of Aria Studio

python3 -m venv $HOME/aria_studio
```

### Install Aria Studio

Install `aria_studio` with pip

```
source $HOME/aria_studio/bin/activate

python -m pip install aria_studio --no-cache-dir
```


### Run Aria Studio

```
aria_studio
```

Aria Studio will then open in your web browser.


![Aria Studio login screen](/img/ARK/aria_studio/aria_studio.png)

Sign in using your Project Aria username and password.

:::info Closing the browser won't quit the application
If you close the browser, Aria Studio will continue to run in the background, which can be helpful when running MPS requests. Use Ctrl + C in the command window to quit the application.
:::

To return to your installation of Aria Studio at any time, restart the virtual environment using the following command:

```
source $HOME/aria_studio/bin/activate
```

And then run `aria_studio`.


## Using Aria Studio

On the main page you’ll see options to view recordings on your glasses, recordings on your computer, grouped recordings and past MPS requests.

You’ll also be able to see the status of any glasses plugged into your computer.


## Recordings on glasses

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer
2. Select **Recordings on glasses**
    * If you do not see a connected device, try:
        * Changing ports
        * Plugging the glasses in more directly if you’re using a USB hub
        * If your glasses battery is flat, wait 10 minutes for them to charge
        * If you’re on [Linux you may need to fix driver issues](/ARK/troubleshooting/linux_usb_driver.mdx)
3. You’ll see a thumbnail preview of the recording, plus metadata for each recording

From this page you can see video previews of each recording, download recordings and delete recordings.

When recordings are downloaded, they’ll also download a JSON file containing the file’s metadata. Metadata can also be extracted from the VRS file, but the JSON file provides a text editor readable file with recording profile, name, OS version the recording was made with, etc.


## Recordings on computer

From “Recordings on computer” you can request MPS, add recordings to a group or visualize the recordings. Select the info icon (or file information in Actions) for recording metadata or status of MPS requests associated with that file.

When you request MPS, the output results will be automatically downloaded to an MPS folder in the requesting VRS file’s directory.

## Groups

In the “Groups” page you can create new groups, examine recordings within a group or request Multi-SLAM MPS processing on a group of recordings. VRS files are not duplicated when they are grouped. So one file can be in multiple groups, without taking up extra storage space.

Go to “Recordings on computer” to add recordings to a group.  For a Multi-SLAM request to be successful, all recordings in the group need to have used recording profiles that collect SLAM camera and IMU data.

### Creating and using groups

1. Go to Groups and select **Create a new group**
2. Provide a group name
    * The group name needs to be a valid directory name, as this will be the name of the folder where outputs are automatically downloaded to
3. Select a directory
    * This directory will define where the group folder for outputs will be saved
    * VRS recordings will not be added to this directory
    * The outputs will include a JSON file with the file paths of all the VRS source files
4. Go to Recordings on computer to add VRS files to the group
    * You can select multiple VRS files at the same time
5. Return to Groups
    * Select the info icon to view group or individual recording data
    * Select Request MPS to request Multi-SLAM MPS


## Past MPS requests

Past MPS requests is a page that logs the status of current and previous MPS requests.

## Troubleshooting/FAQ
### My MPS request didn’t automatically download!

MPS requests can only be downloaded when Aria Studio is open. Open Aria Studio to check the status of MPS requests. You’ll see “Successfully Downloaded” as the status.

### What happens if I quit Aria Studio while files are uploading?
Next time you open Aria Studio the uploads should resume. Once files have successfully uploaded you’ll see “Processing” as the status.

### What are the different statuses and steps when submitting MPS requests?
Go to the [MPS CLI Guide](/ARK/mps/request_mps/mps_cli_guide.mdx#how-the-mps-cli-works) for details about how the back end works.

### How do I quit Aria Studio?
Press Ctrl + C in the original console where aria_studio was started.

### Unable to login (on Mac)
Go to [MPS Troubleshooting - Authentication issue on macOS](/ARK/mps/mps_troubleshooting.mdx#authentication-issue-on-macos) if you encounter this issue.

### Where are my groups?
Groups are stored locally and associated with a specific user. So if you’ve logged into Aria Studio using a different account name, you won’t see the groups associated with another user.
