# How to Join the Academic Partners Workplace Group

## Overview

As part of the Aria Research Kit (ARK), you'll get access to the
_Project Aria Academic Partner Announcements Feedback and Support Workplace Group_.
This group is Aria's research community space where researchers and engineers at Meta and all our Academic partners can connect, ask questions, share ideas and provide support.

In addition to being the place where we make announcements, we want to support researchers to:

* Provide feedback about their Aria experiences
* Participate in general discussions about Aria
* Ask our community of researchers and engineers questions (support related or exploring an idea)
* Engage with other academic researchers and perhaps even set challenges for each other


Once you've joined this group you can post support queries in the group or directly message our user support team.

This group is specifically for people who are working with Aria Devices.

## How to Join

:::note Please do not add extra people to this group
If someone who is approved for the ARK and has received Aria glasses is missing, please let your Meta point of contact know.

When you first onboard with Project Aria you will receive two emails. One will contain account credentials that you'll use with the Partner Portal and the Companion App.

The second email will invite you to join the Project Aria Workplace Group. The email will be from [_notification@fbworkmail.com_](mailto:notification@fbworkmail.com) and have the subject “Join [person] in Project Aria Academic Partner Announcements, Feedback and Support”.
