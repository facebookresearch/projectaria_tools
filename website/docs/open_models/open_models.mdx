# Project Aria Open Models

Project Aria has released several open models, powered by Project Aria data, and with the ability to extend beyond Aria data.

* [EgoBlur](egoblur.mdx) - an open source AI model from Meta to preserve privacy by detecting and blurring PII from images. Designed to work with egocentric data (such as Aria data) and non-egocentric data.
* [Project Aria Eye Tracking](eye_tracking.mdx) - an open source inference code for estimating eye gaze direction and visualizing the outputs.
* [SceneScript](scenescript.mdx) - an AI model and method to understand and describe 3D spaces.
