# Getting Started With AEA

## Overview

This section provides a step-by-step guide to run the Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) quickstart tutorial in a Jupyter notebook.

This notebook covers how to:


* Access raw sensor data (VRS files)
* Visualize Eye Gaze data
* Visualize Speech data
* Load concurrent sequences from multiple Project Aria glasses in a shared space location
* Use Timecode to get synchronized data between two devices


## Run Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab

Use the following link to run the Python notebook in an installation free playground:

* [Aria Everyday Activities (AEA)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/main/projects/AriaEverydayActivities/examples/aea_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb)



## Running the Jupyter Notebook locally


### Step 0 : Check system requirements and download codebase

[Ensure your system is supported and then download projectaria_tools codebase from the github](/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase.mdx)


### Step 1 : Install Python

If you have already installed `projectaria-tools` using [Python Package Installation](/data_utilities/installation/installation_python.mdx), you can skip to Step 4. The AEA Python code is part of the main `projectaria-tools` package.

If you have problems using Jupyter examples, please [upgrade python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to the latest version.

### Step 2 : Create a virtual environment


```
rm -rf $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

python3 -m venv $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

source $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env/bin/activate
```


### Step 3 : Install `projectaria-tools` from PyPI

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip

python3 -m pip install projectaria-tools'[all]'
```


### Step 4 : Run Tutorial

From your projectaria_tools Python virtual environment, run:

```
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox

jupyter notebook projectaria_tools/projects/AriaEverydayActivities/examples/aea_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb
```
