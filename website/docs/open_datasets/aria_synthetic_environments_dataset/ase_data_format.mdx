# ASE Data Format

This page gives an overview of the data format and organization and helps researchers to quickly understand the data. With the help of snippets and tools listed in [Data Tools and Visualization](ase_data_tools), they can quickly onboard this data in their ML pipelines.

There is a separate subdirectory for every scene, which is named by a unique ID (0 - 100K). Within each scene directory, there are separate files and directories for different types of data as follows:


## Overall Data Organization

## Aria RGB Sensor - Image, Depth and Instance Segmentation

For each frame from the RGB sensor we provide the vignetted sensor image, simulated 16 bit metric depth (mm) in PNG image format and the segmentation image (16 bit PNG). The images in each folder are in sync i.e. there will be same number of images in each folder. We also provide example data visualizers to load these images and/or associate them.

## ASE Scene Language Format

The ASE Scene Language format is set of hand-designed procedural commands in pure text form. To handle commonly encountered static indoor layout elements, we use three commands: **make_wall**, **make_door**, and **make_window**.

Each command includes its own set of parameters, as described below. Given the command’s full set of parameters, a geometry is completely specified. For example, for **make_wall**, the full set of parameters specifies a gravity-aligned oriented box, while make_door and make_window specify box-based cutouts from walls.

A single scene is described via a sequence of multiple commands. The sequence length is arbitrary and follows no specific ordering. The interpretation of the command and its arguments is carried out by a customized interpreter responsible for parsing the sequence and generating a 3D mesh of the scene.

## Trajectory and Semi-dense Map Points

Ground-truth trajectory data provides poses for each frame generated from simulation at 10 FPS.
We are following the same trajectory format as [the closed loop trajectory in MPS](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_trajectory#closed-loop-trajectory).

For the Semi-dense Map point clouds and their observations, we are following the same [point cloud points and observations format as MPS](/docs/data_formats/mps/mps_pointcloud). The Semi-dense Map point cloud is generated from the same algorithm in MPS, with ground-truth trajectory and simulated SLAM camera images.
