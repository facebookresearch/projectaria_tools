# HOT3D Dataset

HOT3D is a new benchmark dataset for vision-based understanding of 3D hand-object interactions. This dataset contains over 800 minutes of egocentric recordings, with 33 diverse hand-held objects, capturing over one million multi-view frames of hand-object interactions.

The dataset contains:

* Synchronized multi-view egocentric videos from Project Aria glasses and Quest 3 VR headset
* High-quality 3D pose annotations of hands and objects
* 3D object models with PBR materials
* 2D bounding boxes
* [Eye Gaze MPS data](/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze.mdx) (Aria only)
* [Semi-Dense Point Cloud MPS data](/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_pointcloud.mdx) (Aria only)

HOT3D uses its own specific downloader, available in the HOT3D GitHub repository, enabling you to download Quest3, Aria and object models data.

## Getting Started

Go to the [https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/hot3D/](http://Projectaria.com) to find out more about the dataset and to get access to it.

Go to the [HOT3D GitHub repository](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hot3d) to install HOT3D Python tooling that will enable you to download and visualize HOT3D data.

* Use the [HOT3D Jupyter notebook tutorial](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hot3d/blob/main/hot3d/HOT3D_Tutorial.ipynb) to get to know the downloader and visualizers.
