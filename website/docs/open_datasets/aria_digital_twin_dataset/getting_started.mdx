# Getting Started With ADT

## Overview
This section provides a step-by-step guide to run the Aria Digital Twin (ADT) quickstart tutorial in a Jupyter notebook.

This notebook provides a walkthrough of:
* Loading an ADT sequence
* Accessing and visualizing all ADT ground-truth data:
    * 6DoF object poses
    * 2D object bounding box
    * Segmentation images
    * Depth images
    * Skeleton and synthetic rendering
    * Eye gaze
* An example of undistorting ADT ground-truth data

We also have an [Advanced Tutorial](advanced_tutorials.mdx) that will walk you through getting synchronized ground truth data in a multi-person sequence.

## Run Jupyter Notebook on Google Colab
Use the following link to run the Python notebook in an installation free playground:
* [Aria Digital Twin (ADT)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/blob/1.3.3/projects/AriaDigitalTwinDatasetTools/examples/adt_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb)


## Running the Jupyter Notebook locally

### Step 0 : Check system requirements and download codebase

[Ensure your system is supported and then download projectaria_tools codebase from the github](/docs/data_utilities/installation/download_codebase)

### Step 1 : Install Python

If you have already installed `projectaria-tools` using [Python Package Installation](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_python), you can skip to Step 4. The ADT Python code is part of the main projectaria-tools package.

If you have problems using Jupyter examples, please [upgrade python3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) to the latest version.

### Step 2 : Create a virtual environment

```bash
rm -rf $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

python3 -m venv $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env

source $HOME/projectaria_tools_python_env/bin/activate
```

### Step 3 : Install projectaria_tools from pypi

```bash
pip3 install --upgrade pip

pip3 install projectaria-tools'[all]'
```

### Step 4 : Download Sample Sequence:

Download the sample ADT sequence by following steps 0 to 4 in
[How to Download the ADT Dataset](dataset_download.mdx#download-the-sample-aria-digital-twin-adt-sequence).

### Step 5 : Run Tutorial

From your projectaria_tools python virtual environment, run:

```bash
cd $HOME/Documents/projectaria_sandbox

jupyter notebook projectaria_tools/projects/AriaDigitalTwinDatasetTools/examples/adt_quickstart_tutorial.ipynb
```
