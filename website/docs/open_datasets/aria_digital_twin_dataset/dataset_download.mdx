# How to Download the ADT Dataset
By downloading the datasets you agree that you have read and accepted the terms of the [Aria Digital Twin Dataset License Agreement](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/adt/license/).

## Download the sample Aria Digital Twin (ADT) sequence

### Step 0: install project_aria_tools package and create venv if not done before

Follow Step 0 to Step 3 in [Getting Started](/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset/getting_started).

### Step 1 : Visit [ADT website](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/adt/) sign up.

Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Enter you email and select **Access the Datasets**.

### Step 2 : Download the download-links file
Once you've selected **Access the Datasets** you'll be taken back to the top of the ADT page.

Scroll down the page to select **Aria Digital Twin Download Links** and download the file to the folder $HOME/Downloads.

:::info The download-links file will expire in 14 days
You can redownload the download links whenever they expire

### Step 3 : Set up a folder for ADT data

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_adt_data

mv $HOME/Downloads/aria_digital_twin_dataset_download_urls.json $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_adt_data/
```

### Step 4 : Download the sample sequence (~500MB) via CLI:

From your Python virtual environment, run:

```bash
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader -c $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_adt_data/aria_digital_twin_dataset_download_urls.json \
-o $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_adt_data/ \
-d 0 1 2 3 -e
```

The sample dataset is a single-user dataset with body pose in the Apartment. This is a pretty representative example to give an idea of the dataset.

### Data size

Aria Digital Twin dataset consists of 222 sequences in total. The total size of the dataset is about 3.5TB. The dataset is split into 4 data types that can be downloaded individually. The size of each data type is below.

| **Data type** | What's included | Per sequence size | Total size for all sequences |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| main | Aria raw data, 2D bounding box, 3D object poses and bounding box, skeleton data, eye gaze data | 3 - 6 GB | ~700 GB |
| segmentation | Instance segmentation data | 2 - 4 GB | ~750 GB |
| depth | Depth map data | 4 - 8 GB | ~1.5 TB |
| synthetic | Synthetic rendering data | 2 - 4 GB | 500 GB |

### Data content

The ADT dataset was recorded in two spaces: an apartment and an office environment.
The apartment is composed of a living room, kitchen, dining room and bedroom,whereas the office space is a single room with very minimal
office furniture. The apartment has 281 unique stationary
objects and the office room has 15 unique stationary objects.
Given some objects have multiple instances that may differ
slightly, the apartment has a total of 324 stationary object
instances and the office room has 20 stationary object instances. In addition, there are 74 single-instance dynamic
objects shared between two spaces.

We release 222 sequences in total with 170 sequences
in the apartment and 52 sequences in the office room. We
designed 5 single-person activities and 3 dual-person activities in the apartment.

The single-person activities are:

* room decoration
* meal preparation
* work
* object examination
* room cleaning

The dual-person activities include:

* partying
* room cleaning
* dining table cleaning

Every activity has 10 to 50 sequences and these activities names are embedded into the seqeuence_names.

Note for the office dataset, we only include object examination as the single-person activity.

Other statistics:

* Number of multi-person sequences: 77
* Number of sequences with no skeletons: 110
* Number of sequences with 1 skeleton: 92
* Number of sequences with 2 skeleton: 20

Note that we provide a mix of datasets where users may or may not be wearing an Aria and/or a bodysuit.
Please refer to the skeleton_aria_association.json to see the case for each specific subsequence.

### Download via CLI

Follow the [ADT Getting Started Guide](/docs/open_datasets/aria_digital_twin_dataset/getting_started) to download the example data. This section will introduce how to download the dataset using the `adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader`.

#### Resumable download

The `adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader` checks the previous download status of the sequences in the --output_folder. If the downloading breaks in the middle, relaunch the CLI and it will continue the downloading.

#### Detailed arguments

| **Arguments** | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| --cdn_file | str | The download-urls file you downloaded from the ADT website page after signing up |
| --output_folder | str | A local path where the downloaded files and metadata will be stored |
| --metadata_only | flag | Only download the metadata |
| --data_types | list of int | 0→main, 1→segmentation, 2→depth, 3→synthetic |
| --example_only | flag | Only download example data |
| --overwrite | flag | Disable resumable download. Force download and overwrite existing data |
| --sequence_names | list of str | list of sequence names. If not specified, download all sequences |

### Download Examples

Note that all these commands must be run from your Python virtual environment that has the projectaria-tools package and dependencies installed.

#### Download metadata for ADT datasets

```
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --metadata_only
```

#### Download main data for all sequences

```
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0
```

#### Download all data for all sequences

```
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 1 2 3
```

#### Download main data for 2 specific sequences

```
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 --sequence_names Lite_release_recognition_BambooPlate_seq031 Lite_release_recognition_BirdHouseToy_seq030
```

#### Download main data for all sequences and overwrite

```
adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 --overwrite
```

### Select specific sequences

The dataset metadata JSON “aria_digital_twin_benchmark_metadata.json”, which can be downloaded using `adt_benchmark_dataset_downloader`, contains metadata for each ADT sequence.

The metadata fields of each sequence are:

| **Field Name** | Description |
| --- | --- |
| scenes | The scene that a sequence is captured at, Apartment or LiteOffice, in the current ADT release, there will only be one element in the list |
| is_multi_person | Whether the sequence is a single person activity or a multiperson activity |
| num_skeleton | number of persons whose body skeleton is tracked |

`aria_digital_twin_dataset_searcher.py` is an example Python script for filtering sequences via different criteria.
