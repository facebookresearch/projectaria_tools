title: Camera intrinsic models
---

A camera intrinsic model maps between a 3D world point in the camera coordinate and its corresponding 2D pixel on the sensor. It supports mapping from the 3D point to the pixel (projection) and from the pixel to the ray connecting the point and the camera's optical center.

Our projection models are based on polar coordinates of 3D world points. Given a 3D world point in the device frame $\mathbf{P}_d$, we first transform it to the camera's local frame
$$
\mathbf{P}_c = (x, y, z) = T_\text{device}^\text{camera}\mathbf{P}_d
$$

the corresponding polar coordinates $\Phi = (\theta, \varphi)$ that satisfies
$$
    x/z = \tan(\theta)\cos(\varphi), \quad
    y/z = \tan(\theta)\sin(\varphi).
$$

We assume the camera has a single optical center and thus all points of the same polar coordinate maps to the same 2D pixel $\mathbf{p}$:
$$
    \mathbf{p} = f(\phi)
$$
Here $f$ is the camera projection model.

Inversely, we can unproject from a 2D camera pixel to the polar coordinate by
$$
    \Phi = f^{-1}(\mathbf{p})
$$

In Aria we support four types of project models, Linear, Spherical, KannalaBrandtK3, and FisheyeRadTanThinPrism. The linear camera model are standard textbook intrinsic models and good for image rectification. However, cameras on the Aria glasses all have fisheye lenses, and spherical camera model are much better approximations for these glasses. In order to calibrate the camera lenses at a high quality, we use two more sophisticated camera models to add modeling of radial and tangential distortions.

## The linear camera model
The linear camera model (a.k.a pinhole model) maps from world point $(x,y,z)$ to 2D camera pixel $\mathbf{p}=(u, v)$ by
$$
    u = f_x x/z + c_x = f_x tan(\theta) \cos(\varphi) + c_x, \qquad
    v = f_y y/z + c_y = f_y tan(\theta) \cos(\varphi) + c_y.
$$
where $(f_x, f_y)$ are the focal length, and $c_x, c_y$ are the image center.

Inversely, we can unproject from 2D camera pixel $\mathbf{p}=(u, v)$  to the homogeneous coordinate of the world point by
$$
x/z=(u-c_x)/f_x, \quad y/z=(v-c_y)/f_y.
$$
The linear camera model preserves linearity in 3D space, thus straight lines in the real world are supposed to look straight under the linear camera model.

## The spherical camera model

The spherical camera model is similar to the linear camera model, yet the pixel coordinates are linear to solid angles rather than the homography coordinate system.
$$
    u = f_x \theta \cos(\varphi) + c_x, \qquad
    v = f_y \theta \cos(\varphi) + c_y.
$$
where $(f_x, f_y)$ are the focal length, and $c_x, c_y$ are the image center.
Note the difference from the linear camera model — under spherical projection, 3D straight lines look curved in images.

Inversely, we can unproject from 2D camera pixel $\mathbf{p}=(u, v)$ to the homogeneous coordinate of the world point by
$$
    \theta = \sqrt{(u - c_x)^2/f_x^2 + (v - c_y)^2/f_y^2}, \quad
    \varphi = \arctan((u - c_x)/f_x, (v - c_y)/f_y).
$$

## The KannalaBrandtK3 (KB3) model

The KannalaBrandtK3 model adds radial distortion to the linear model
$$
    u = f_x r(\theta) \cos(\varphi)  + c_x, \quad
    v = f_y r(\theta) \sin(\varphi)  + c_y.
$$
where
$$
    r(\theta) = \theta + k_0 \theta^3 + k_1 \theta^5 + k_2 \theta^7 + k_3 \theta^9 + ...
$$
In KannalaBrandtK3 model we use a 9-th order polynomial with four radial distortion parameters $k_0, ... k_3$.

To unproject from camera pixel $(u, v)$ to the world point $(\theta, \varphi)$, we first compute
$$
    \varphi = \arctan((u - c_x)/f_x, (v - c_y)/f_y) \quad
    r(\theta) = \sqrt{(u - c_x)^2/f_x^2 + (v - c_y)^2/f_y^2}
$$
Then we use Newton method to inverse the function $r(\theta)$ to compute $\theta$.

## The Fisheye624 model

The Fisheye624 model adds tangential distortion on top of the KB3 model.
$$
    u = f(u_r + t_x(u_r, v_r))  + c_x, \quad
    v = f(v_r + t_y(u_r, v_r))  + c_y.
$$
where
$$
    u_r = r(\theta) \cos(\varphi), \quad
    v_r = r(\theta) \sin(\varphi).
$$
and
$$
    t_x(u_r, v_r)  = p_0(2 u_r^2 + r(\theta)^2) + 2p_1u_rv_r, \\
    t_y(u_r, v_r)  = p_1(2 v_r^2 + r(\theta)^2) + 2p_0u_rv_r.
$$

To unproject from camera pixel $(u, v)$ to the world point $(\theta, \varphi)$, we first use Newton method to compute $u_r$ and $v_r$ from $(u - c_x)/f_x$ and $(v - cy)/f_y$, and then compute $(\theta, \varphi)$ using the above KB3 unproject method.
