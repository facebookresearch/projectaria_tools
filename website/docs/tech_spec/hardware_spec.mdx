# Project Aria Hardware Specifications

Project Aria glasses have five cameras (two Mono Scene, one RGB, and two Eye Tracking cameras) as well as non-visual sensors (two IMUs, magnetometer, barometer, GPS, Wi-Fi beacon, Bluetooth beacon and Microphones). Mono Scene Cameras are often used to support SLAM algorithms, but they can have other applications.

The glasses support multiple recording profiles that enable users to choose which sensors to record with, as well as what settings to use.

:::note
Cameras on Project Aria devices are installed sideways. Project Aria Tools visualizers rotate the images to show a more natural view.

### Non-visual sensors

The non-visual sensors in Aria glasses are:

* Two IMUs operating at 1000Hz and 800Hz respectively
* One Magnetometer operating at 10Hz
* One barometer operating at 50Hz
* Seven-channel spatial microphone array with a sampling rate of 48kHz
    * The microphone also has a stereo mode where only two channels record
* One GPS receiver, Wi-Fi beacon, and Bluetooth beacon.

All cameras, as well as the IMU, magnetometer, barometer and microphone are calibrated and all sensor measurements are timestamped on a common clock at nanosecond resolution. The SLAM and RGB cameras have [fisheye](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisheye_lens) lenses to maximize the visible field of view.

### Coordinate systems

Applications like stereo vision and navigation usually handle 2D and 3D points in different spaces, and transformations need to be conducted between them. With Project Aria data, we attach a local R3 coordinate frame to each sensor.

To find out more about the coordinate systems and access calibration data, got to:
* [2D Image Coordinate System Conventions](/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/2d_image_coordinate_system_convention)
* [3D Coordinate Frame Conventions](/docs/data_formats/coordinate_convention/3d_coordinate_frame_convention)
* [Calibration Code Snippets](/docs/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/calibration)


## Other hardware specifications

### Compute

* Qualcomm SD835, 4GB RAM, 128GB storage
* Flash memory (UFS)
* Android 7.1
* SW configurable user button and switch

### Weight & Size

75g in two sizes 147mm and 152mm frame width, with adjustable nose pads and temple arms (87% fit coverage).

### Visual Correction

Removable lenses with plano (Non-Rx) or single vision Rx correction [-4.5D to +3.5D].

### Battery Life

Capacity is 2.5Wh. Operating time depends on the [recording profile](/docs/tech_spec/recording_profiles).
Battery life is 1.5 hours of continuous recording + 30 hours standby when using profile 0:
* 10 FPS ET x 2
* 10 FPS Mono Scene (SLAM) x 2
* 1 FPS RGB 8MP
* IMU, Wi-Fi + GPS and 7-channel audio on at nominal FPS

Aria glasses connects to USB via a magnetic connector on the right temple arm.
