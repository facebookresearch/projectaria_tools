## Introduction

**Project Aria** is a research platform developed by Meta Reality Labs Research to enable both internal teams at Meta and external researchers to push the state of the art in egocentric AI research. Project Aria supports a wide range of research in computer vision, robotics, contextual AI, and more, by providing access to advanced wearable devices, open datasets, and robust software tools.

This documentation is dedicated to the **Aria Gen 2 glasses** and their associated tools, data, and models. If you are looking to work with the latest generation of Aria hardware and software, you are in the right place.

## What’s New with Aria Gen 2 Glasses?

Aria Gen 2 glasses introduce significant improvements over the first generation, including:

- **Longer battery life** (6–8 hours)
- **Upgraded sensors:**
  - 12MP RGB camera
  - 4 computer vision cameras (wider FOV, front-facing stereo pair, HDR)
  - Eye tracking, dual 6-axis IMUs, barometer, magnetometer, 7 spatial microphones, GNSS
  - **New:** Proximity sensor, contact microphone, PPG health sensor, ambient light sensor
- **Real-time on-device machine perception** with a custom Meta co-processor
- **Direct interactivity** via contact microphone and open air speakers
- **Foldable form factor** for improved portability
- **Enhanced streaming:** Sensor data and on-device perception signals can be streamed to a local PC via USB or wirelessly

## Project Aria Platform Overview

Project Aria’s offering to the research community is organized into two major pillars:

- **Open Science Initiatives:**
  Access open-source egocentric datasets, models, and tools for working with Aria data. Participate in research challenges and contribute to the advancement of egocentric AI.

- **Aria Research Kit:**
  A specialized toolkit for egocentric data collection and real-time protytpe, including the Aria Gen 2 glasses, mobile companion app, dataset management tools, command-line utilities, Machine Perception Services (MPS), and a Client SDK for custom development. Qualified research partners can apply for access to the [Aria Research Kit](https://www.projectaria.com/research-kit/).
