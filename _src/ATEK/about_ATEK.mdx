## What is ATEK?

Project Aria has released various public datasets for academic researchers over the past year, such as Aria Everyday Activities, Aria Digital Twin,
Aria Synthetic Environments, Nymeria and HOT3D. It is exciting to observe the growing usage of Aria public datasets from the community to accelerate
egocentric machine perception tasks. ATEK is designed to accelerate development cycles when working on Deep-Learning related tasks that use Aria data.


## 4 key features to accelerate your workflow

* An easy-to-use data preprocessing library for Aria datasets for converting VRS-format Aria datasets in to datasets in PyTorch-compatible format
* Datastore of preprocessed data sets in WebDataset format
* Standardized evaluation libraries that supports the following ML perception tasks for Aria:
  * static 3D object detection
  * 3D surface reconstruction
* Notebooks and script examples including model training, inference, and visualization
