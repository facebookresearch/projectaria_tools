<img width="40%" src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/aria_wi-fi2.jpg')} alt="Wi-Fi settings screen, showing IP address"/>

</div>

### Aria Device Settings

Device Settings can be accessed by tapping the Paired Glasses info card on the main dashboard.

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="80%" src={useBaseUrl('/img/ARK/mobile_app_device_settings.png')} alt="Device Settings page from the Dashboard"/>
</div>

The Device Settings page includes:

* Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, Battery, GPS and Temperature status
* OS version and ability to check for OS updates
* Remaining storage space
* MAC Address
* Serial number
* Device ID
* Check Device Mode (it should say Partner)
* Change the default recording profile


### Recordings menu

In the Recordings menu, you'll be able to see recordings that are currently on your Aria glasses.

Select a recording in the Recording menu to edit your recording's name and notes (notes will be stored in the vrs.json file) and see a range of details including:

* Recording duration
* Recording profile used
* Up to 10 thumbnail images from your recording

If you have not given your recording a name (such as when you initiate recording via the capture button) the VRS file will have a random alphanumeric name when it is downloaded.

To name or edit the name of a VRS recording on your glasses:

1. Go to the recordings tab of the Mobile app
2. Select a recording
3. Select **Edit** on the top right corner


### Profile menu

The Profile menu shows the settings and profile information for the Mobile Companion app, not your Aria glasses. You'll be able to see the App version, for example, but not the Aria glasses' OS.

The Advanced Settings menu includes **Clear Local Data**. This can be helpful if you encounter issues that restarting your Mobile App does not resolve. Aria recordings are stored on the glasses, not on the phone, so clearing local data will not delete any of your recordings.
