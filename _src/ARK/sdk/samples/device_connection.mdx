# Connect to the glasses and retrieve device status

## Overview

The `device_connect` example shows how to connect to your Project Aria device using the Client SDK and retrieve:
* Device status, such as such as battery level, Wi-Fi SSID or Wi-Fi IP address
* Device information, such as the device serial number or device model

## Running the sample

In your terminal, from the samples directory, run:

```bash
python -m device_connect
```

You should then see:

```
[AriaSdk:DeviceControllerImpl][INFO]: Connecting to device <serial_number> using ADB
[AriaSdk:DeviceClientImpl][INFO]: Connection established with device <serial_number>
Aria Device Status: battery level 100, wifi ssid <xxxxxxxx> , wifi ip <192.168.xx.xx>, mode DeviceMode.Partner
Aria Device Info: model Aria, serial <serial_number>
Aria Device Connected, disconnecting
```

### Code walkthrough

#### 1. Create and configure a Device Client

`DeviceClient` allow you to connect to Project Aria glasses over Wi-Fi or USB.

```python
device_client = aria.DeviceClient()
```

By default, `DeviceClient` connects to Aria glasses over USB. To connect to glasses over Wi-Fi, configure the `DeviceClient` by creating a `DeviceClientConfig`, setting `ip_v4_address` and setting the config.

```python
client_config = aria.DeviceClientConfig()
if args.ip_address:
    client_config.ip_v4_address = args.ip_address
device_client.set_client_config(client_config)
```

:::info
Get your Aria glasses' IP address from the Mobile Companion App by tapping [Wi-Fi on the Dashboard](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#dashboard).

#### 2. Connect to a Device
Connect to the Aria glasses and retrieve a `Device` instance. An Exception will be thrown if the connection is not successful.

```python
device = device_client.connect()
```

#### 3. Fetch device status and information
We can then obtain the device status and information:

```python
status = device.status
print(
    "Aria Device Status: battery level {0}, wifi ssid {1}, wifi ip {2}, mode {3}".format(
        status.battery_level,
        status.wifi_ssid,
        status.wifi_ip_address,
        status.device_mode,
    )
)
```

Check out the [full status list](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference#ariasdkdevicestatus).

```python
info = device.info
print(
    "Aria Device Info: model {}, serial {}, manufacturer {}".format(
        info.model, info.serial, info.manufacturer
    )
)
```

Check out the [full information list](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference#ariasdkdeviceinfo).

#### 4. Disconnect

Once all operations have been completed, you can disconnect from your glasses to release any held resources.

```python
device_client.disconnect(device)
```
