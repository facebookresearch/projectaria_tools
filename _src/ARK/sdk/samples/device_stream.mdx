# Streaming and Visualizing All Live Sensor Data

## Overview
This page shows how to run the code sample `device_stream` to:

* Start and stop streaming data from Aria glasses over USB and Wi-Fi
* Visualize the sensor streams from Aria's RGB, Mono Scene (SLAM), ET cameras and IMU sensors

:::note
These code samples require Python 3.9+ because of a fastplotlib dependency
:::

## Run `device_stream`

### Example 1: Start and stop streaming over USB

1. Plug your Aria glasses into your computer, using the provided USB cable
2. From the samples directory in Terminal, run:

```bash
python -m device_stream --interface usb --update_iptables
```

You should then see:

<div style={{textAlign: 'center'}}>
<img width="100%" height="100%" src={useBaseUrl('img/ARK/sdk/device_stream.png')} alt="Aria Live Stream Window"/>
</div>

:::note
Cameras on Aria glasses are installed sideways. The visualizer rotates the raw image data for a more natural view.
:::


3. There are several ways you can stop streaming:
  * Press q or ESC to quit the app
  * Use Ctrl-C to terminate in terminal
  * Press the Capture button on your glasses




### Example 2: Start and stop streaming over Wi-Fi
Streaming over Wi-Fi is similar, with a few extra steps.

1. Connect your Aria Glasses and Computer to the same Wi-Fi compatible Wi-Fi network:
   * Check [Requirements](/docs/ARK/sdk/setup.mdx) for details about compatible routers
2. Open the Mobile Companion app and tap [Wi-Fi on the Dashboard](/docs/ARK/mobile_companion_app#dashboard) to see your glasses' IP address
3. From the samples directory in Terminal, run:

```bash
python -m device_stream --interface wifi --device-ip <Glasses IP> --update_iptables
```

Make sure you replace `<Glasses IP>` with the IP address you got from the Mobile Companion app

If you're on MacOS and lose internet connection, run `aria-doctor` in a separate terminal.

4. Stop streaming using any of the methods listed in Example 1


### Code walkthrough

#### 1. Get StreamingManager instance
Use [StreamingManager](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference#ariasdkstreamingmanager) to start and stop streaming.

```python
streaming_manager = device.streaming_manager
```

#### 2. Configure Streaming Settings (optional)

Specify the profile name for the streaming in [StreamingConfig](/docs/ARK/sdk/api_reference#ariasdkstreamingconfig), otherwise you'll use your glasses' [default recording profile](/docs/ARK/ARK_quickstart#set-your-default-recording-profile). If a default recording profile has not been set, you'll stream using profile18. Go to the [Sensor Profiles page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/sdk_sensor_profiles) for supported profiles and their specs.

```python
streaming_config = StreamingConfig()
streaming_config.profile_name = args.profile_name
```

Use ephemeral streaming certificates to protect your streamed data from being eavesdropped by other computer without certificate. This needs to be set to `true` when no persistent certificates were pre-installed. Go to the [Streaming Internals page](/docs/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals.mdx) on the various aspects of streaming security and how certificates are used.

```python
streaming_config.security_options.use_ephemeral_certs = True
streaming_manager.streaming_config = streaming_config
```

#### 3. Start Streaming

Start streaming using all the previously set configurations.

```python
streaming_manager.start_streaming()
```

#### 4. Write callbacks for each sensor data stream

Create an observer class derived from `BaseStreamingClientObserver` defined in `visualizer.py`. Find the complex example named `AriaVisualizerStreamingClientObserver` in `visualizer.py`, which is used in this sample app to fetch and visualize data from each sensor.

Find a simpler example in [undistort_rgb_image.py](/docs/ARK/sdk/samples/undistort_rgb_image) to fetch RGB data from the stream:

```python
class StreamingClientObserver:
  def __init__(self):
      self.rgb_image = None

  def on_image_received(self, image: np.array, record: ImageDataRecord):
      self.rgb_image = image
```

#### 5. Register callbacks in the streaming client
Once your observer class is defined, you will need to register it with a stream client object.

```python
# get streaming client from the streaming manager
streaming_client = streaming_manager.streaming_client
# create custom visualizer and streaming client observer class instances
aria_visualizer = AriaVisualizer()
aria_visualizer_streaming_client_observer = AriaVisualizerStreamingClientObserver(aria_visualizer)
# register callbacks
streaming_client.set_streaming_client_observer(aria_visualizer_streaming_client_observer)
```

#### 6. Visualize live stream

Subscribe to the live stream data and enter the rendering loop to visualize the streaming data until the window is closed.

```python
streaming_client.subscribe()
aria_visualizer.render_loop()
```

#### 7. Stop the stream & free resources
Once you've finished streaming, unsubscribe from `StreamingClient` instance, so that any held resources can be released, stop streaming and disconnect the device.

```python
streaming_client.unsubscribe()
streaming_manager.stop_streaming()
device_client.disconnect(device)
```
