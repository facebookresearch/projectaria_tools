# Aria Client SDK API Reference

## Overview

This page provides a list of Project Aria Client SDK's Python APIs. There is one global function in this API. Classes appear next in alphabetical order, then enums in alphabetical order.

## Global Functions & Methods

See `Level` in the `Enums` section.

| Function                    | Type | Description                     |
|-----------------------------|------|---------------------------------|
| set_log_level(level: Level) | None | Sets the SDK logging verbosity. |

## Classes

Generally, classes in the API maintain state about configurations and processes like streaming and recording. Concerns about security, networking, synchronization, and physical connections are all managed through classes described in this section.

Some classes have properties and methods, some classes have only properties. Properties can be read-only or read-write. Methods are primarily for side-effect, with return type `None`, with a few exceptions.
