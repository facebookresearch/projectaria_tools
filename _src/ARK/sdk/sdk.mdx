# Project Aria Client SDK

The Project Aria Client SDK provides versatile APIs to help you create your own machine perception Python applications with Project Aria glasses.

### Client SDK features

After connecting your Project Aria glasses and PC via USB or WiFi, you will be able to:
- Retrieve device information, status and sensor calibration data
- Start and stop recording
- Configure, start and stop streaming from the glasses
- Subscribe to streaming data from the glasses
- Create time synchronized recordings between multiple devices using TICSync

### Project Aria CLI

In addition to APIs and code samples, the SDK also provides the [Aria CLI](/docs/ARK/sdk/cli), which allows you to control Project Aria glasses and manage their data without touching any code.


### This documentation covers:

* [Setup Guide](/docs/ARK/sdk/setup)
    * Prerequisites
    * Download and install the Client SDK
    * Pair your Aria glasses to the computer
    * Extract SDK samples
* Code samples to demonstrate using the SDK to control Project Aria glasses and build you own real-time applications.
    * [Connection](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_connection.mdx): connect an Aria device to a computer, fetch the device information and status.
    * [Recording](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_recording.mdx): start and stop a recording via USB and Wi-Fi.
    * [Streaming Subscription](/ARK/sdk/samples/streaming_subscribe.mdx): subscribe to and unsubscribe from a streaming device
    * [Streaming and Visualizing All Live Sensor Data](/ARK/sdk/samples/device_stream.mdx): programmatically start and stop a streaming session, add callbacks to visualize and manipulate the streamed data
    * [Streaming Undistorted RGB Image Using Calibration](/ARK/sdk/samples/undistort_rgb_image.mdx): programmatically start and stop a streaming session, access sensor calibration and undistort an RGB live stream
    * [TICSync Time Synchronization](ARK/sdk/samples/ticsync_sample.mdx)
* Core Concepts
    * [Sensor Profiles](/ARK/sdk/concepts/sdk_sensor_profiles.mdx): access information about Aria recording profiles via the CLI or SDK
    * [Streaming Internals](/ARK/sdk/concepts/streaming_internals.mdx): deeper dives into how data is streamed
    * [About TICSync](/ARK/sdk/concepts/about_ticsync.mdx)
* [API References](/ARK/sdk/api_reference.mdx)
* [CLI documentation](/ARK/sdk/cli/cli.mdx)
* [SDK Troubleshooting](/ARK/sdk/sdk_troubleshooting.mdx)
