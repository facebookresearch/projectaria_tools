# Pair Additional Glasses and Pairing Troubleshooting

## Overview
This page provides information about how to pair additional Project Aria glasses, as well as troubleshooting if your device does not pair.

## Terminology

Within this page, we refer to device pairing/forgetting and device connecting/disconnecting. These terms are not interchangable, and have specific implications.

### Pairing/Unpairing
* **Pair(ed)**: connecting a device to the Mobile Companion App for the first time.
* **Unpair(ed)**: the process of unpairing a device from the Mobile Companion App. This will delete all data stored locally on the device.

### Connecting/Disconnecting
* **Connect(ed)**: the Mobile Companion App has active control over the device.
* **Disconnect(ed)**: the Mobile Companion App no longer has active control over the device.

Multiple devices can be paired with the one account, but only one can be connected to the Mobile Companion app at a time.

## Adding Glasses

1. Plug your glasses into power, using the provided cable
    * Your device will automatically power on when you plug it in
2. Make sure the privacy switch is in the "off" or "forward" position (i.e., away from the crossed-out camera icon)
3.  Select the **Add Glasses** button on the Aria dashboard. The app will then start looking for nearby Aria glasses
4. Follow the the typical app and glasses set up flow to finish pairing your new device and update the OS

## Unpairing Aria glasses

1. Go to Device Settings
    * Tap the Paired Glasses info card on the Dashboard
2. Select **Unpair Glasses**


## Glasses Not Pairing?

### If there are no error messages
1. Kill/Force Stop the app
2. Restart the Mobile Companion App
3. Try to pair your device again

### Error message, device is owned by someone else
Aria glasses can only be associated with one user account. Factory reset your glasses to enable them to be paired with this account.

1. Turn on the Privacy Switch (i.e., in the recordings disabled position).
2. Tap (press but do not hold) the power button and the capture button at the same time.
    * The [Aria Glasses User Manual](/ARK/glasses_manual/glasses_user_manual.mdx#factory-reset) contains a video of how to factory reset your glasses
3. The device will reboot. After a while, you will see the LED near the power button flashing purple.
4. Select **Add Glasses** in the Mobile Compaion App's dashboard and follow the normal pairing flow.
