## Proper Handling and Cleaning

- **Handle the Glasses with care & avoid damage.** The Glasses are sensitive electronic equipment and should be handled with care.
- **Do not try to bend the temples arms.** Attempting to fold them like normal glasses will damage them.
- Do not drop, strike, or shake your Glasses excessively. Do not use the Glasses if they are damaged.
- The Glasses are not intended for use as safety glasses or eye protection.
- Do not use with other head mounted displays, such as virtual reality headsets or other glasses.
- **Storage.** Store the Glasses in a clean, dry, temperature-controlled environment. Do not leave in an unattended vehicle where temperatures may reach hot or cold extremes.
- **Water & liquids.** Your Glasses are resistant to water splashes but are not designed for submersion in water or extended exposure to water or other liquids. If water exposure occurs, dry your Glasses thoroughly and clear the charging areas of residue or other debris.
- **Cleaning.** Clean using a microfiber cloth or a lens cleaning wipe. Do not soak, rinse, or submerge.

### You can't fold the glasses, but you can adjust the tips of the temple arms

## Detailed Cleaning Instructions

### To sanitize

Use 70% pre moistened alcohol lens wipes with a light touch.

### To clean

Clean the eyeglass lenses with a dry microfiber cloth or with a traditional lens cleaner available at any optical store.

Try your best to only use a microfiber cloth for cleaning. Wash the microfiber cloth with soap and water at least weekly and air dry to ensure cleanliness of cloth. Do not use any paper products such as paper towels or Kleenex as it will damage the anti-reflective coating on the lenses. If a microfiber cloth is not available, you can use a 100% soft cotton cloth to wipe your lenses.

Be mindful not to get the camera lenses and sensors wet as much as possible. It's best to spray the cloth first (soap+water mixture ok to use too) to dampen then wipe the lenses with it.

### Charging

Your Aria glasses must be connected to a charger to upload data. It connects to USB via its magnetic connector on the right arm. If you see the LED flashing red on the inside of the right temple arm, your battery is depleted.

* Any active recordings will be stopped and deleted when the switch is engaged.

## Device ID

Aria glasses have a unique device_ID. Unlike the serial number, the device_ID is reset every time the device is a factory reset or the glasses are unpaired.

Aria glasses must go through a factory reset before they can be paired to a new user, so the device_ID will always be associated with a single user account (although an individual user may have multiple devices associated with their account).

Note: disconnecting your glasses does not trigger a factory reset, only unpairing them so that a new user may use the glasses. The serial number persists and is tied to the device, like any other product.

You can find the Device ID for your glasses in the Mobile Companion App Device Settings.
