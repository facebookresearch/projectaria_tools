# MPS CLI

## Overview


The Project Aria MPS Command Line Interface (MPS CLI) is part of Project Aria Tools (available on MacOS and Linux) that enables users to request [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/ARK/mps/mps.mdx). [Aria Studio](/ARK/aria_studio.mdx) is a web-based application that builds on Aria MPS CLI capabilities.

MPS CLI features:

* Request [SLAM](/data_formats/mps/slam/slam.mdx), [Eye Gaze](/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze.mdx) and [Hand Tracking](/data_formats/mps/hand_tracking/hand_tracking.mdx) data
* Request [multi-sequence SLAM data](/data_formats/mps/slam/mps_multi_slam.mdx)
* Auto run health checks prior to upload
    * Recordings will not be uploaded if they are not valid for any of the MPS services requested
* Resumable uploads
    * Uploads, interrupted for any reason, can be resumed within 24 hrs
    * Particularly useful for large VRS files
* Concurrent processing
    * CLI takes a list of directories/files as input and recursively finds all .vrs files to process concurrently
    * The number of concurrent processes for each stage can be modified in [Settings](mps_cli_guide.mdx#settings)
* Automatically downloads outputs once processing is complete
* Recordings are processed once
    * If the output directory already exists and contains the MPS results, processing is skipped
    * If the recording was processed in the past, the results will be downloaded without submitting the recording for processing again (unless --force is passed as an input)
* Uploaded data is stored for 30 days
    * Additional MPS can be requested without needing to upload again
    * Data can be reprocessed without needing to upload again
* CLI can be integrated into your automated workflows
    * This includes ensuring that all commands and processes work without using the UI
    * See the [Command Line Reference](mps_cli_guide.mdx#command-line-reference) for more details
