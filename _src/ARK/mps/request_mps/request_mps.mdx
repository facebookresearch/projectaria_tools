# How to request MPS

Cloud based [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/ARK/mps/mps.mdx) are available to Project Aria research partners to generate SLAM, Multi-Slam, Eye Gaze and Hand Tracking derived data outputs. Partner data is only used to serve MPS requests. Partner data is not available to Meta researchers or Metaâ€™s affiliates. Go to [MPS Data Processing](/ARK/mps/mps_processing.mdx) for more details about how data is processed.

The preferred ways to request MPS are:
* [MPS CLI](/ARK/mps/request_mps/mps_cli.mdx)
    * Installed as part of the pip installation version of Project Aria Tools
* [Aria Studio](/ARK/aria_studio.mdx)
    * A web-based application that builds on features of the MPS CLI
