## Device and Recording Issues

### I can't start recording

Check that the privacy switch is not engaged. The switch should be pushed forward (towards the lenses of your device) for recording to be possible.

### Where's my recording?

It is possible you may have accidentally discarded your recording.  Do not use the privacy switch to stop recording, as it prevents recording and deletes any current recording.

### Stop recording does not work/ has a long delay
The longer a device records for, the longer it takes for a recording to stop. This is because the larger the VRS file, the longer it takes a recording to finish indexing.

:::note
Recording has not fully stopped until the Recording LEDs have turned off
