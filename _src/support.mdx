## How do I get support/report issues?

We encourage you to post issues, feedback and feature requests to GitHub, so that they can be tracked.

* [Project Aria Tools Issues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/issues) - recommended for:
    * Project Aria Tools issues
    * OSI and ARK issues whenever they don't have a standalone GitHub repository (such as most open datasets, the Client SDK or MPS CLI)
* [EgoBlur Issues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/EgoBlur/issues) - recommended for issues about EgoBlur open models
* [Hot3D Issues](https://github.com/facebookresearch/hot3d/issues) - recommended for issues about the HOT3D open dataset

If you are a Research Partner with access to the Aria Research Kit there are several other support options available, although GitHub is ideal for bug reports and feature requests.

* Post to Project Aria Discord - best for discussion, feedback or user support
* Post to [Academic Partners Feedback and Support workplace group](/ARK/workplacegroup.mdx) - discussion, feedback or user support
* Email AriaOps@meta.com - for feedback or user support
