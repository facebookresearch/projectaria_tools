# Collaborative Tools

## Overview

This page provides an overview of open source tooling can be useful when working with Project Aria data.

## Used in Project Aria Tools

Some of the open source tools we use are:

### VRS

[VRS](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vrs) is the open source file format used by [Project Aria](https://projectaria.com). It is optimized to record & playback streams of sensor data, such as images, audio samples, and any other discrete sensors (IMU, temperature, etc), stored in per-device streams of time-stamped records.

* [VRS Readme](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vrs)
* [VRS Core functionality](https://github.com/facebookresearch/vrs/tree/main/vrs)


### Rerun

[Rerun](https://www.rerun.io/) is an open source SDK and engine for visualizing and interacting with multi modal data streams. It can be used from Python, Rust and C++ and provides a log API and a visualizer. Project Aria Tools uses it to create Python visualization tools.

## Open source tools that use Project Aria

### Nerfstudio

[Nerfstudio](https://docs.nerf.studio/) provides an API that allows for a simplified end-to-end process for creating, training, and testing NeRFs. The library supports a more interpretable implementation of NeRFs by modularizing each component.
