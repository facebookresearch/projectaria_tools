title: Aria Synthetic Environments Dataset
---


## Overview

Project Aria Tools provides Python and C++ APIs to access the Aria Synthetic Environments (ASE) dataset.

## About the data

[Aria Synthetic Environments (ASE)](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/) is a large scale dataset of 100K unique procedurally-generated scenes of interior layouts of apartments filled with 3D objects, and simulated with the sensor characteristics of Aria glasses. For each scene we have the rendering of a person walking around the synthetically generated rooms of the layout. These rooms vary from living rooms, bedrooms & kitchens to bathrooms. In addition to the renders, each of these scenes come with semi-dense maps for the Aria walkthrough, which are aligned to the Ground Truth (GT) scene layout.

This dataset was created to provide the wider research community with a dataset large enough to surface new challenges and research opportunities for first person object detection and tracking that had not been feasible.

In the [ASE: Scene Reconstruction Challenge](ase_challenges.mdx), we invite researchers to train full scene structured language description models, drawing from the 100K annotated scenes, and then test their models on 1K test scenes provided in the challenge.


## **Dataset Contents**

* 100,000 unique multi-room interior scenes
* Simulated with realistic device trajectories
* Across ~2-minute trajectories
* Populated with ~8000 3D objects
* With semi-dense map representations
* Annotated using ASE Scene Language
    * User oriented natural language mapping with architectural features, such as doors, windows and pillars, described with a CAD-like language that includes the feature type, location and dimensions
    * Unlocks new exciting ways to tackle research challenges related to reconstruction and detection tasks

**Simulated sensor data per sequence**
* 1 x outward-facing RGB camera stream
* Simulated Aria camera & lens characteristics

**Ground Truth Annotations**
* 6DoF camera trajectory
* 3D floor plan in Euston Structure Scene Language (SSL) format
* 2D instance segmentation
    * With per-scene mappings from the object instance image IDs to object classes
* 2D depth map
