# Aria Everyday Objects Dataset
## Overview

Aria Everyday Objects (AEO) is a small, challenging 3D object detection dataset for egocentric data.
AEO consists of approximately 45 minutes of egocentric data across 25 sequences captured by non-computer vision experts collected in a diverse set of locations throughout the US.
Oriented 3D bounding boxes have been annotated for each sequence. Annotation is done in 3D, using the camera calibration,
SLAM trajectory and SLAM semi-dense point cloud to assist with annotation. 1037 3D object bounding box instances across 17 classes: Bed, Chair, Couch, Door, Floor, Lamp, Mirror, Plant, Refrigerator, Screen, Sink, Storage, Table, Wall, WallArt, WasherDryer, and Window. The dataset is designed to accelerate research in egocentric 3D perception.
