## About the data

The Digital Twin Catalog (DTC) dataset provides static objects capturing sequences collected using Project Aria glasses and digital single-lens reflex (DSLR) cameras,
combined with high quality ground truth data including device trajectories, reconstructed objectsâ€™ digital twin copies with geometry and material assets,
aligned object poses. We also provide processed sensor data from our [Machine Perception Services](/docs/ARK/mps). Go to [DTC Data Format](digital_twin_catalog_data_format.mdx) to see a full list of the data we provide.

The DTC dataset contains 2000 accurately scanned and reconstructed 3D models with detailed geometry and material information (in .glb),
200 Aria sequences and 100 DSLR sequences recording static objects whose digital twin copies are within the 2000 released models.
In the Aria sequences, there are 100 single-instance static objects each recorded under two different human walking trajectories,
active and passive (casual). In the DSLR sequences, there are 50 single-instance static objects each recorded under two different lighting conditions.

Go to the [Dataset Download](digital_twin_catalog_download_dataset.mdx) page to get started with the sequence data. For more info on downloading and viewing captured models, see [Object Models](digital_twin_catalog_object_models.mdx) page.

### Active Trajectory

100 Aria sequences were recorded by taking a 360 walk around the captured objects. Each sequence will record one single object.
The Aria glasses will stay within a relatively close distance to the object.

### Passive (Casual) Trajectory

100 Aria sequences were recorded by taking a casual walk around the captured objects. Each sequence will record one single object.
The sequence will include trajectories such as walking towards the object, circling around the object and walking away from the object.

### DSLR Sequence

105 DSLR sequences were recorded under 2 different lighting conditions. The sequences were recorded using three DSLR cameras mounted on robot arms with three different viewing directions towards the object. We also provide 2 corresponding lighting environment maps for the DSLR sequences.
