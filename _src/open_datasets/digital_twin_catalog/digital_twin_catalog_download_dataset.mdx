# How to Download the DTC Dataset

## Overview​

This page covers how to download Digital Twin Catalog (DTC) sequences.
Follow the instructions to download the sample datasets and from there you'll be able to use the CLI to download more data.
For information on how to download DTC object models, see [Object Models](/docs/open_datasets/digital_twin_catalog/digital_twin_catalog_object_models.mdx) page

The sample dataset is an Aria sequence recording a single object with active trajectory. This is a pretty representative example that should give you an idea of the dataset.

By downloading the datasets you agree that you have read and accepted the terms of the [Digital Twin Catalog Dataset License Agreement](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/license/).

## Download the sample Digital Twin Catalog (DTC) sequence

### Step 0: install project_aria_tools package and create venv if not done before​

Follow Step 0 to Step 4 in [Getting Started](/docs/open_datasets/digital_twin_catalog/digital_twin_catalog_getting_started.mdx).

### Step 1 : Signup and get the download links file

To use the downloader CLI, you need to download a file which contains all data URLs plus some metadata for the downloader script. We currently offer two ways of getting this file:

#### Option 1 - Aria Dataset Explorer:

Go to the [Aria Dataset Explorer](https://explorer.projectaria.com/) website. Here you can subselect sequences according to some filter options, or get the links to all sequences.

#### Option 2 - Digital Twin Catalog on Project Aria Website:

Visit [Digital Twin Catalog on Project Aria Website](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/) and sign up.
Scroll down to the bottom of the page. Enter your email and select Access the Datasets.

Once you've selected Access the Datasets you'll be taken back to the top of the DTC page.
Scroll down the page to select the `Digital Twin Catalog Download Links` and download the file to the folder `$HOME/Downloads`.

### Step 2 : Set up a folder for DTC data
```
mkdir -p $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_dtc_data
```

### Step 3 : Download the sample sequence(~1.3GB) via CLI:

From your Python virtual environment, run:
```
aria_dataset_downloader -c ${PATH_TO_YOUR_Aria_Sequence_CDN_FILE} \
-o $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_dtc_data/ \
-l BirdHouseRedRoofYellowWindows_active \
-d 0 1 2 3 6
```
For more information on the content in the other sequences, see the Data Content section below


### Step 4 : Set up a folder for DTC DSLR data
```
mkdir -p $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_dtc_dslr
```

### Step 5 : Download the DSLR sample sequence (~2.0GB) via CLI:
From your Python virtual environment, run:
```
aria_dataset_downloader -c ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DSLR_Sequence_CDN_FILE} \
-o $HOME/Documents/projectaria_tools_dtc_dslr/ \
-l Airplane_B097C7SHJH_WhiteBlue_Lighting001 \
-d 0 1
```
For more information on the content in the other sequences, see the Data Content section below


## Download the Digital Twin Catalog (DTC) dataset

### Data size​
The Digital Twin dataset consists of 200 Aria sequences and 105 DSLR sequences. The Aria sequences will include MPS data, which can be downloaded individually.
Go to [Project Aria Machine Perception Services](/docs/ARK/mps) for more information about MPS data.
The size of each data type is shown below.

### Download via CLI

DTC supports both using the general Aria dataset downloader, which is available in the [projectaria_tools PyPI (pip install) package](/docs/data_utilities/installation/installation_python.mdx),
to download sequences and using our open sourced Aria dataset downloader Python wrapper, which is available in the [DTC code repo](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/projects/AriaDigitalTwinDatasetTools),
to download sequences with captured models.

To use the Aria downloader, use the following commands in the virtual environment where you've installed projectaria_tools:
```
aria_dataset_downloader
```

To get a description of the arguments that the script needs, run:
```
aria_dataset_downloader --help
```
The following are some example use cases:

### Download VRS for all sequences
```
aria_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DTC_SEQUENCE_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0
```
### Download VRS + main ground truth data for all sequences
```
aria_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DTC_SEQUENCE_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 6
```
### Download all data for all sequences
```
aria_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DTC_SEQUENCE_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
```
### Download VRS for 2 specific sequences
```
aria_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DTC_SEQUENCE_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 --sequence_names BirdHouseRedRoofYellowWindows_active BirdHouseRedRoofYellowWindows_passive
```
### Download VRS for all sequences and overwrite
```
aria_dataset_downloader --cdn_file ${PATH_TO_YOUR_DTC_SEQUENCE_CDN_FILE} --output_folder ${OUTPUT_FOLDER_PATH} --data_types 0 --overwrite
```
