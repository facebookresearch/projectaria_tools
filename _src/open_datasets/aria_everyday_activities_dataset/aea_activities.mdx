# AEA Activities

When creating recordings for one to two Project Aria glasses wearers for the Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) dataset, we created scripts to represent all day long activities with always on sensing. Each script contained multiple scenarios that told a story about people going through their day. The scripts provided general guidance for an improvised scenario. Actors did not have specific lines to learn, instead they followed prompts and went with what felt most natural to to them.


* Script 1: Lazy Morning Before the Party – Single Wearer
* Script 2: Catch Up and Have Some Fun – Two Wearers
* Script 3: What Do You Want For Dinner? – Two Wearers
* Script 4: Easy Like Sunday Morning – Single Wearer
* Script 5: Get Home Then Get Going – Single Wearer

Go to [Recording Scripts](aea_scripts.mdx) for more details and sequence numbers.
