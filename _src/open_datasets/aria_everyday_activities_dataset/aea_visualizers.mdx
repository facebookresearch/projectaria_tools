# Aria Everyday Activities Visualization

To help you visualize and debug your algorithms when using the Aria Everyday Activities (AEA) dataset, we’ve provided a Python based visualizer that can work with time synchronized data from multiple Project Aria glasses in a shared world location.

## Python Visualizer

`viewer_projects_aea` displays an interactive view of one or two synchronized sequences using [Rerun](/data_utilities/visualization/visualization_python.mdx#rerun). It also allows you to see all data in a 3D context.

### Visualization of a single sequence:

```
viewer_projects_aea --rotate-image --path loc1_script2_seq1_rec1
```

### Visualization of two time synchronized recordings “locX_scriptY_seqZ_rec(1/2)”

The following command enables you to visualize recordings that were made in the same space and time.
Select `timecode_ns` from the timeline to view the data via synchronized timestamps, and select `device_time_ns` to see device specific timestamps.

Go to [Timestamp Definitions](/data_formats/aria_vrs/timestamps_in_aria_vrs.mdx) to find out more about Project Aria data timestamps.

```
viewer_projects_aea --rotate-image --path loc1_script2_seq6_rec1 loc1_script2_seq6_rec2
```

### Visualization of aligned 3D data in a single location

The MPS Viewer can be used to visualize all the recordings, across multiple sessions and users that were recorded in the same location.

Go to [Visualization of Multi-SLAM data](data_utilities/visualization/visualization_python.mdx#multi-slam) for more details.

Go to [Data Utilities Troubleshooting](/data_utilities/installation/troubleshooting.mdx) if you experience any issues.
