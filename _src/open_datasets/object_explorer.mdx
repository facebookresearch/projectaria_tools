# DTC Object Explorer

## Overview

The [DTC Object Explorer](https://dtc.projectaria.com/) is an interactive webtool that allows researchers to find, visualize, and download high-quality [Digital Twin](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/) object models in the common GLB format. Like the [Aria Dataset Explorer](dataset_explorer/dataset_explorer.mdx), the DTC Object Explorer has filtering tools that allow you to filter objects by various metadata attributes, such as texture, category, and license. Interactive visualization tools help you quickly verify you’ve found the models you want before downloading those object models to your local machine.

## Using DTC Object Explorer
Visit https://dtc.projectaria.com/ to use the DTC Object Explorer. Once there, you have a number of ways to engage with the explorer:

### Filter the kinds of objects that appear
In the **Filter objects by** search bar near the top of the site, you can enter a variety of properties, such as **object_uid**, **category**, and **texture**. You can specify what you're looking for regarding each property. The search results will automatically update for each restriction you add, and you can clear all your current filters by selecting the "X" on the search bar. The complete list of properties is as follows:
* object_uid
* release - The sequence dataset with which the object is associated.
* category
* linked_sequence - A linked sequence in Dataset Explorer.
* license
* avg_metallic - A measure of how metallic the surface of the object is.
* avg_roughness - A measure of how rough the surface of the object is.
* texture - Either shiny or matte.
* num_vertices
* num_triangles

### Change which object properties are displayed for the search results
The search results are displayed as a grid of objects that meet your filtering criteria. Each item in the search results will display its image at a minimum and its **object_uid** and **category** by default, but you can specify additional properties to be displayed for each item by clicking in the **Displayed properties** bar and selecting new ones. You can also remove current properties from being displayed by selecting the "X" next to each.

### Object details
Clicking on an object (as opposed to selecting its checkbox) will take you to a page dedicated specifically to that object. It features an in-browser interactive viewer where you can view the digital object from all angles. It also includes all the object’s metadata, as well as the option to download the object directly.

### Select and bulk download objects
All objects returned by your search are selected by default: you can select/deselect specific objects by clicking their checkboxes. You can also deselect all currently selected objects by clicking **Clear Selected** or select all objects in the search results by clicking **Select All**, both of which are near the top right of the site.

Once you're satisfied with your choice of objects, you can download all the objects you've selected by clicking **Download selected objects** in the top right of the site. You'll be asked to enter and submit your email address in order to access the object files. Once you've done so, you can choose which specific assets you want to download (**3d-asset_glb**, **license**, and/or **metadata**), then select **Download selected objects** to download the relevant JSON.

As part of downloading the JSON, an **Object Documentation** pop-up with instructions on how to install the Project Aria Tools Python package (one-time setup) and access object data will appear.
