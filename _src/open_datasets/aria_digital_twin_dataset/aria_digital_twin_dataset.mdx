# Aria Digital Twin Dataset

## Overview

Project Aria Tools provides Python and C++ APIs to access the [Aria Digital Twin (ADT) dataset](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/adt/)
([paper](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2023/html/Pan_Aria_Digital_Twin_A_New_Benchmark_Dataset_for_Egocentric_3D_ICCV_2023_paper.html)).

## About the data
ADT provides raw and synthesized sensor data from Project Aria glasses, combined with groundtruth data generated using a motion capture
system including depth images, device trajectories, object trajectories and bounding boxes, and human tracking.
We also provide processed sensor data from our [Machine Perception Services](/ARK/mps/mps.mdx).
Go to [ADT Data Format](data_format.mdx) to see a full list of the data we provide.

The ADT dataset contains 236 sequences recording single and dual-person activities.
The data was recorded in two spaces: an apartment and a single room office.
There are 74 single-instance dynamic objects shared between the two spaces.

Go to the [Getting Started Tutorial](getting_started.mdx) to explore the sample dataset (available on Google colab, no download necessary)
or the [Dataset Download page](dataset_download.mdx) to get started.

The sample dataset is a single-user dataset with body pose in the Apartment.
It is a pretty representative example that should give you an idea of the dataset.

In addition to the sensor data and annotated ground truth data, we also provide high quality 3D object models (in .glb) for each of the objects in ADT.
For more info on downloading and viewing these models, see [Object Model](object_models.mdx) page.

:::info NEW UPDATE!
3D object model release is new as of September 2024

### Apartment scene
284 sequences were recorded in the apartment scene. The apartment comprised of a living room, kitchen, dining room and bedroom and contained
281 unique stationary objects.

Given some objects have multiple instances that may differ slightly, the apartment has 324 stationary object instances in total.

### Office scene
52 sequences were recorded in the office scene, a single room with minimal office furniture.
The office room contained 15 unique stationary objects and 20 stationary object instances.


### Activities
In the office scene, users examined objects. For the apartment scene we designed five single-person activities and three dual-person activities.

The single-person activities were:

* Room decoration
* Meal preparation
* Work
* Object examination
* Room cleaning

The dual-person activities included:

* Partying
* Room cleaning
* Dining table cleaning

Every activity has 10 to 50 sequences and the activity names are embedded into the sequence_names.


:::info
We provide a mix of datasets where users may or may not be wearing an Aria and/or a bodysuit.
Please refer to the `skeleton_aria_association.json` to see the case for each specific sub-sequence.
