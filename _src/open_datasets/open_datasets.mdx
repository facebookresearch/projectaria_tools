# Project Aria Open Datasets

This section provides information about how to use Project Aria's open data.

* [Aria Dataset Explorer](dataset_explorer/dataset_explorer.mdx) - a centralized hub for Project Aria public datasets that helps users efficiently find, preview and download Aria data
* [Aria Everyday Activities Dataset](aria_everyday_activities_dataset/aria_everyday_activities_dataset.mdx) - multiple activity sequences where 1-2 users wearing Project Aria glasses participate in everyday activities to capture time synchronized data in a shared world location
* [Aria Digital Twin Dataset](aria_digital_twin_dataset/aria_digital_twin_dataset.mdx) - raw and synthesized sensor data from Project Aria glasses, combined with ground truth data generated using a motion capture system including depth images, device trajectories, object trajectories and bounding boxes, and human tracking
* [DTC Object Explorer](object_explorer.mdx) - an interactive webtool that allows researchers to find, visualize, and download high-quality [Digital Twin](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/dtc/) object models in the common GLB format.
* [Aria Synthetic Environments Dataset](aria_synthetic_environments_dataset/aria_synthetic_environments_dataset.mdx) - a large scale dataset of 100K unique procedurally-generated scenes of interior layouts of apartments filled with 3D objects, and simulated with the sensor characteristics of Aria glasses
* [Ego-Exo4D Dataset](ego-exo4d/ego-exo4d.mdx) - more than 800 participants from 13 cities worldwide performed these activities in 131 different natural scene contexts, yielding long-form captures from 1 to 42 minutes each and 1,422 hours of video combined
* [HOT3D Dataset](hot3d.mdx) - a new benchmark dataset for vision-based understanding of 3D hand-object interactions
* [Reading in the Wild Dataset](ritw.mdx) - a new benchmark dataset designed to inform models that determine whether or not subjects are reading.
