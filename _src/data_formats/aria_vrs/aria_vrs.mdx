# Project Aria VRS

## Overview

This page provides an overview of how Project Aria uses [VRS](https://facebookresearch.github.io/vrs/). The other pages in this section are:

* [VRS Files Timestamps](/docs/data_formats/aria_vrs/timestamps_in_aria_vrs)


## How Project Aria uses VRS

Project Aria chose VRS as its data container because it is a file format designed to record and playback streams of [XR (extended reality)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_reality) sensor data and supports huge file sizes. These VRS files contain streams of time-sorted records generated for each sensor, with one set of sensors per stream. Project Aria data uses VRS for features such as:

* Records are structured as a succession of typed content blocks.
* Project Aria Tools recordings are structured following this VRS <code>[DataLayout](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/core/data_provider/data_layout)</code>. These definitions provide an overview of what information can be extracted for each stream from a Project Aria sequence.
* Streams contain <code>Configuration</code>, <code>State</code> and <code>Data</code> records, each with a timestamp in a common time domain for the whole file.
* Playback is optimized for timestamp order, which is key for network streaming.
* Random-access playback is supported via VRS.

Project Aria Tools aims to provide effective tools, APIs and wrappers for working with VRS, so working with VRS tools directly should not be necessary when working with Aria data. If there are VRS functions you wish Project Aria Tools has, please contact us using any of our [Support Channels](support.mdx).
