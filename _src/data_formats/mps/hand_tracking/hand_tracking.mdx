# MPS Output - Hand Tracking

Project Aria's [Machine Perception Services (MPS)](/ARK/mps/mps.mdx) uses Project Aria's SLAM (mono scene) camera images to estimate the hand movement of the wearer.

Hand Tracking outputs are available for all recordings made with SLAM cameras and can be requested using the [MPS CLI](/ARK/mps/request_mps/mps_cli.mdx). When research partners submit data for processing, the data is only used to serve MPS requests. Partner data is not made available to Meta researchers or Metaâ€™s affiliates. Go to [MPS Data Lifecycle](/ARK/mps/mps_processing.mdx) for more details about how partner data is processed and stored.


Go to [MPS Code Snippets](/data_utilities/core_code_snippets/mps.mdx) for how to:
* Load the hand tracking data (21 landmarks, wrist to device transformation, wrist and palm positions and normals)
* Transform them to the world coordinate frame
* Project them onto the SLAM or RGB images

Hand Tracking data can be visualized in [Python](/data_utilities/visualization/visualization_python.mdx) or [C++](/data_utilities/visualization/visualization_cpp.mdx).

## Hand Tracking Outputs

We currently provide hand tracking data. The file outputs are:
* `hand_tracking_results.csv` - the coordinates of 21 hand landmark positions, wrist and palm normals in the device frame, and the full 6DoF transform from the hand frame (origin at wrist position) to the device frame
* `wrist_and_palm_poses.csv` - the coordinates of the wrist and palm positions, and normal vectors indicating orientation, in the device frame
* `summary.json` - high-level report on MPS hand tracking

### hand_tracking_results.csv

`hand_tracking_results.csv` contains the following fields:
The landmark positions, and wrist and palm normal vectors are given in the device frame in meters.
The translation from the hand frame to the device frame is given in meters.

![The 21 keypoints](/img/data_utilities/21-keypoints.png)

The 21 landmarks are indexed from 0 to 20, representing key points on the hand. These landmarks correspond to specific joints and locations as follows:
| **Landmark ID** | **Description**   |
|---|---|
|0 | Thumb Fingertip|
|1 | Index Finger Fingertip|
|2 | Middle Finger Fingertip|
|3 | Ring Finger Fingertip|
