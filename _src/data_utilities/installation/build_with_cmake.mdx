# How to Use CMake with Project Aria Tools

To use projectaria_tools for your own projects with CMake, we recommend adding it as a submodule in your project.

1. Add the submodule

```bash
cd /path_to_your_project

git submodule add https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools.git
```
2. In your project root CMakeLists.txt, add the projectaria_tools subdirectory

```cmake
add_subdirectory(projectaria_tools)
```
3. Link your project targets (libraries or executables) to projectaria_tools modules.
For example, to link with the sensor_calibration library, use:

```cmake
target_link_libraries(my_target
  PUBLIC
    sensor_calibration
)
```

### Example code
Please refer to the [sample project](https://github.com/facebookresearch/projectaria_tools/tree/main/sample_project) for a full example.

:::info Install targets are coming soon!
So that you can install projectaria_tools and access it using find_package() in your CMakeLists.txt
