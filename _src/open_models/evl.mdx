# Egocentric Voxel Lifting (EVL)

## Overview

EVL is an opensource AI model from Meta for 3D object detection and surface reconstruction on ProjectAria recordings.
EVL is trained on simulation data, namely [Aria Synthetic Environments](https://www.projectaria.com/datasets/ase/).
It relies on frozen 2D foundation features to set a competitive performance. EVL leverages all egocentric modalities from Aria
including posed and calibrated RGB and greyscale video streams and semidense points.
