# Project Aria Open Models

Project Aria has released several open models, powered by Project Aria data, and with the ability to extend beyond Aria data.

* [EgoBlur](egoblur.mdx) - an open source AI model from Meta to preserve privacy by detecting and blurring PII from images. Designed to work with egocentric data (such as Aria data) and non-egocentric data.
* [Egocentric Voxel Lifting (EVL)](evl.mdx) - an opensource AI model from Meta for 3D object detection and surface reconstruction on ProjectAria recordings.
* [Project Aria Eye Tracking](eye_tracking.mdx) - an open source inference code for estimating eye gaze direction and visualizing the outputs.
* [SceneScript](scenescript.mdx) - an AI model and method to understand and describe 3D spaces.
* [Photoreal Scene Reconstruction](psr.mdx) - a system for reconstructing photorealistic 3D scenes captured from an egocentric device.
