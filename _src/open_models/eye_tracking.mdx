# Project Aria Eye Tracking

## Overview

Project Aria Eye Tracking provides an open source inference model and tooling that can be used to estimate eye gaze direction based on Aria device Eye Tracking camera images. This Pytorch model, trained on data from over ~1200 individuals and ~2M frames, produces outputs that use the [Pre March 2024 Eye Gaze Model](/data_formats/mps/mps_eye_gaze.mdx) data structure.

Use `projectaria_eyetracking` to generate and visualize these outputs on downloaded or streaming data. These outputs will also be compatible with Project Aria Tools MPS eye gaze output and visualizers.
