AriaRaw is a custom ROS2 message type specifically designed to transport Aria sensor data through ROS2 topics. Unlike standard ROS2 messages (like sensor_msgs/Image or sensor_msgs/Imu), AriaRaw is a minimal wrapper that carries raw binary sensor data in its native format.  Why do we need a custom message type?  Preserves original data format: Aria devices stream data in FlatBuffer format, which is highly efficient and compact. Using a custom message preserves this efficiency rather than converting to standard ROS2 formats. Handles diverse sensor types: Aria devices have many sensors (4 SLAM cameras, 2 ET cameras, 1 RGB camera, IMU, magnetometer, barometer, etc.). A single flexible message type can carry data from all sensors rather than creating publisher/subscriber pairs for each sensor type. Future-proof: New sensor types or perception outputs (VIO, eye gaze, hand tracking) can be added without changing the ROS2 message interface. Maintains timing accuracy: Raw binary transport ensures nanosecond-precision timestamps aren't lost in format conversions.  The subscriber side uses the Aria SDK's data converter to decode the raw payload into typed Python objects (NumPy arrays for images, structured data for IMU, etc.).    Custom message: AriaRaw.msg  int64 id uint8[] payload   Message Fields:  id: The message type identifier from the Aria SDK (indicates sensor type)payload: Raw binary data containing the sensor information in Flatbuffer format  AriaRaw.msg is prepackaged into the example code and can be accessed from  cat ~/Downloads/projectaria_client_sdk_samples_gen2/AriaRaw.msg   Create the Custom Message Package​  Follow the ROS2 tutorial for creating custom messages to create a C++ package for the custom message definition.  Important: The package MUST be named aria_data_types  This exact package name is required because the publisher and subscriber example code import the custom message using:  from aria_data_types.msg import AriaRaw   If you use a different package name, the example code will fail with import errors.  Build Order Build the aria_data_types message package first before building the Python publisher/subscriber package. The Python package depends on the custom message types being available.

Now that the packages are built, you can run the publisher and subscriber nodes to stream and process Aria sensor data.  Important: Before running the nodes, ensure both terminals use the same ROS_DOMAIN_ID so they can communicate with each other:  export ROS_DOMAIN_ID=0   Add this command to both terminals before running the nodes. This ensures the publisher and subscriber are on the same ROS2 domain and can discover each other.

Setup Data Converter and Global State​  converter = data_converter.OssDataConverter() calibration_received = False   What this does:  Creates converter instance to decode raw sensor dataTracks calibration state - must receive calibration before processing VIO/eye gaze/hand tracking  Why global? Shared between callback functions to coordinate calibration state    3. Raw Message Processing Function​  The raw_message_callback function is the core processing logic. It handles different message types:  def raw_message_callback(raw_message: AriaRaw): if raw_message.payload is None: print(&quot;No payload received, cannot decode this message&quot;) return message = sdk_gen2.SharedMessage(raw_message.id, raw_message.payload) message_id = raw_message.id   Initial processing:  Checks for valid payload (some message types may have empty payloads)Reconstructs SharedMessage from ROS2 AriaRaw messageExtracts message ID for type checking    4.

Listener Callback​  def listener_callback(self, msg): if calibration_received: raw_message_callback(msg)   What this does:  Called for each AriaRaw message received from publisherWaits for calibration before processing (required for VIO/eye gaze/hand tracking)Delegates to raw_message_callback for actual processing  Why wait for calibration? Some conversions (VIO, eye gaze, hand pose) require calibration data to properly transform coordinates.    9. Calibration Callback​  def calib_callback(self, msg): global calibration_received print(&quot;[Calibration] Received device calibration&quot;) converter.set_calibration(msg.data) calibration_received = True print( &quot;[Calibration] Calibration set in converter - VIO, eye gaze, and hand pose decoding enabled&quot; )   What this does:  Receives calibration JSON string from publisherSets calibration in converter - required for coordinate transformationsUpdates global flag to enable message processingLogs confirmation that calibration is ready  This runs once (usually) when subscriber first starts or when late-joining    10.

HandTracking API Reference​  In AriaGen2PilotDataProvider, HandTracking shares similar query APIs:  get_vrs_hand_pose_data_by_index(stream_id, index): Query by index.get_vrs_hand_pose_data_by_time_ns(stream_id, timestamp, time_domain, query_options): Query by timestamp.  # Check if hand tracking data is available handtracking_label = &quot;handtracking&quot; handtracking_stream_id = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_stream_id_from_label(handtracking_label) if handtracking_stream_id is None: print(f&quot;❌ {handtracking_label} data stream does not exist in this VRS file.&quot;) print(&quot;Please use a VRS file that contains valid handtracking data for this tutorial.&quot;) else: print(f&quot;✅ Found {handtracking_label} data stream: {handtracking_stream_id}&quot;) # Get number of hand tracking samples num_handtracking_samples = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_num_data(handtracking_stream_id) print(f&quot;Total hand tracking samples: {num_handtracking_samples}&quot;) # Sample a few hand tracking data points print(&quot;\\n=== HandTracking Data Sample ===&quot;) selected_index = min(5, num_handtracking_samples - 1) hand_data = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_hand_pose_data_by_index(handtracking_stream_id, selected_index) if hand_data is not None: print(f&quot;Sample {selected_index}:&quot;) print(f&quot;\\tTracking timestamp: {hand_data.tracking_timestamp}&quot;) # Print the content of left and right hand if valid if hand_data.left_hand is not None: print(&quot;\\tLeft hand detected&quot;) print(f&quot;\\t\\tConfidence: {hand_data.left_hand.confidence:.3f}&quot;) print(f&quot;\\t\\tLandmarks shape: {len(hand_data.left_hand.landmark_positions_device)}&quot;) print(f&quot;\\t\\tWrist location: {hand_data.left_hand.get_wrist_position_device()}&quot;) else: print(&quot;\\tLeft hand: Not detected&quot;) if hand_data.right_hand is not None: print(&quot;\\tRight hand detected&quot;) print(f&quot;\\t\\tConfidence: {hand_data.right_hand.confidence:.3f}&quot;) print(f&quot;\\t\\tLandmarks shape: {len(hand_data.right_hand.landmark_positions_device)}&quot;) print(f&quot;\\t\\tWrist location: {hand_data.right_hand.get_wrist_position_device()}&quot;) else: print(&quot;\\tRight hand: Not detected&quot;) else: print(&quot;No hand tracking data available at the selected index.&quot;)   Interpolated Hand Tracking Results​  Context:  In Aria-Gen2 glasses, the on-device hand-tracking data are calculated from the SLAM cameras, not RGB cameras. In the meantime, the SLAM cameras and RGB camera often run at different sampling frequencies, and their triggering are not aligned either. This causes the hand tracking result's timestamp to often not line up with that of RGB camera, causing additional challenges in accurately visualizing handtracking results in RGB images.  API to query interpolated handtracking results  To resolve this, AriaGen2PilotDataProvider enables a special query API for handtracking results:  get_vrs_interpolated_hand_pose_data(stream_id, timestamp_ns, time_domain)   which will return an interpolated hand tracking result, given any timestamp within valid timestamps of the VRS file.  Handtracking Interpolation Implementation  Find the 2 nearest hand-tracking results before and after the target timestamp.If the 2 hand-tracking results time delta is larger than 100 ms, interpolation is considered unreliable → return None.Otherwise, interpolate each hand separately: a. For the left or right hand, perform interpolation only if both the &quot;before&quot; and &quot;after&quot; samples contain a valid result for that hand. b. If either sample is missing, the interpolated result for that hand will be None.Single-hand interpolation is calculated as: a. Apply linear interpolation on the 3D hand landmark positions. b. Apply SE3 interpolation on T_Device_Wrist 3D pose. c. Re-calculate the wrist and palm normal vectors. d. Take the min of confidence values.  # Demonstrate interpolated hand tracking (if hand tracking data is available) if handtracking_stream_id is not None: print(&quot;\\n=== Demonstrating query interpolated hand tracking results ===&quot;) # Get SLAM and RGB camera streams for comparison slam_stream_id = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_stream_id_from_label(&quot;slam-front-left&quot;) rgb_stream_id = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_stream_id_from_label(&quot;camera-rgb&quot;) if slam_stream_id is not None and rgb_stream_id is not None: # Retrieve a SLAM frame, use its timestamp as query slam_sample_index = min(10, pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_num_data(slam_stream_id) - 1) slam_data, slam_record = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_image_data_by_index(slam_stream_id, slam_sample_index) slam_timestamp_ns = slam_record.capture_timestamp_ns # Retrieve the closest RGB frame rgb_data, rgb_record = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_image_data_by_time_ns( rgb_stream_id, slam_timestamp_ns, TimeDomain.DEVICE_TIME, TimeQueryOptions.CLOSEST ) rgb_timestamp_ns = rgb_record.capture_timestamp_ns # Retrieve the closest hand tracking data sample raw_ht_data = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_hand_pose_data_by_time_ns( handtracking_stream_id, slam_timestamp_ns, TimeDomain.DEVICE_TIME, TimeQueryOptions.CLOSEST ) if raw_ht_data is not None: from datetime import timedelta raw_ht_timestamp_ns = (raw_ht_data.tracking_timestamp // timedelta(microseconds=1)) * 1000 # Check if hand tracking aligns with RGB or SLAM data print(f&quot;SLAM timestamp: {slam_timestamp_ns}&quot;) print(f&quot;RGB timestamp: {rgb_timestamp_ns}&quot;) print(f&quot;Hand tracking timestamp: {raw_ht_timestamp_ns}&quot;) print(f&quot;Hand tracking-SLAM time diff: {abs(raw_ht_timestamp_ns - slam_timestamp_ns) / 1e6:.2f} ms&quot;) print(f&quot;Hand tracking-RGB time diff: {abs(raw_ht_timestamp_ns - rgb_timestamp_ns) / 1e6:.2f} ms&quot;) # Now, query interpolated hand tracking data sample using RGB timestamp interpolated_ht_data = pilot_data_provider.get_vrs_interpolated_hand_pose_data( handtracking_stream_id, rgb_timestamp_ns, TimeDomain.DEVICE_TIME ) # Check that interpolated hand tracking now aligns with RGB data if interpolated_ht_data is not None: interpolated_ht_timestamp_ns = (interpolated_ht_data.tracking_timestamp // timedelta(microseconds=1)) * 1000 print(f&quot;Interpolated hand tracking timestamp: {interpolated_ht_timestamp_ns}&quot;) print(f&quot;Interpolated hand tracking-RGB time diff: {abs(interpolated_ht_timestamp_ns - rgb_timestamp_ns) / 1e6:.2f} ms&quot;) else: print(&quot;Interpolated hand tracking data is None - interpolation failed&quot;) else: print(&quot;No raw hand tracking data found for comparison&quot;) else: print(&quot;Required camera streams not found for interpolation demonstration&quot;) else: print(&quot;Skipping hand tracking interpolation demonstration - no hand tracking data available.&quot;)   Hand Tracking Visualization​  To visualize hand tracking results in camera images, you need to project the hand landmarks and skeleton into the camera coordinate system using device calibration. Since hand tracking data is already in the Device frame, the transformation is more straightforward than eye tracking.  # Hand tracking visualization helper functions def plot_single_hand_in_camera(hand_joints_in_device, camera_label, camera_calib, hand_label): &quot;&quot;&quot; A helper function to plot a single hand data in 2D camera view &quot;&quot;&quot; # Setting different marker plot sizes for RGB and SLAM since they have different resolutions plot_ratio = 3.0 if camera_label == &quot;camera-rgb&quot; else 1.0 marker_color = [255,64,0] if hand_label == &quot;left&quot; else [255, 255, 0] # Project into camera frame, and also create line segments hand_joints_in_camera = [] for pt_in_device in hand_joints_in_device: pt_in_camera = ( camera_calib.get_transform_device_camera().inverse() @ pt_in_device ) pixel = camera_calib.project(pt_in_camera) hand_joints_in_camera.append(pixel) # Create hand skeleton in 2D image space from projectaria_tools.utils.rerun_helpers import create_hand_skeleton_from_landmarks hand_skeleton = create_hand_skeleton_from_landmarks(hand_joints_in_camera) # Remove &quot;None&quot; markers from hand joints in camera.

See here for a full list of supported sensor types  This API is commonly used for sequential processing—such as iterating through all frames of a single stream—or when you know the exact frame number you want to query within a specific stream.  Important Note:The indices in each stream are independent and not correlated across different sensor streams. For example, the i-th RGB image does not necessarily correspond to the i-th SLAM image. This is because different sensors may operate at different frequencies or have missing frames, so their data streams are not synchronized by index.  # Visualize with Rerun import rerun as rr rr.init(&quot;rerun_viz_query_by_index&quot;) # Get number of samples in stream num_samples = vrs_data_provider.get_num_data(rgb_stream_id) print(f&quot;RGB stream has a total of {num_samples} frames\\n&quot;) # Access frames sequentially, and plot the first few frames first_few = min(10, num_samples) print(f&quot;Printing the capture timestamps from the first {first_few} frames&quot;) for i in range(first_few): # First 10 frames image_data, image_record = vrs_data_provider.get_image_data_by_index( rgb_stream_id, i ) # Access image properties timestamp_ns = image_record.capture_timestamp_ns print(f&quot;Frame {i}: timestamp = {timestamp_ns}&quot;) # Process image data if image_data.is_valid(): rr.set_time_nanos(&quot;device_time&quot;, timestamp_ns) rr.log(&quot;camera_rgb&quot;, rr.Image(image_data.to_numpy_array())) rr.notebook_show()   Query by Timestamp: TimeDomain and TimeQueryOptions​  A key feature of Aria devices is the ability to capture time-synchronized, multi-modal sensor data. To help you access this data with precise temporal control, projectaria_tools provides a comprehensive suite of time-based APIs.  The most commonly used is the timestamp-based query:  get_&lt;SENSOR&gt;_by_time_ns(stream_id, time_ns, time_domain=None, time_query_options=None)   where &lt;SENSOR&gt; can be replaced by any sensor data type available in Aria VRS. See here for a full list of supported sensor types  This API is often used to synchronize data across multiple sensor streams, fetch sensor data at specific timestamps, or perform temporal analysis.  TimeDomain and TimeQueryOptions​  When querying sensor data by timestamp, two important concepts are:  TimeDomain: Specifies the time reference for your query.TimeQueryOptions: Controls how the API selects data relative to your requested timestamp.  Below are all available options for each:  TimeDomain Options​  Name\tDescription\tTypical Use CaseRECORD_TIME\tTimestamp stored directly in the VRS index. Fast access, but time domain may vary.\tQuick access, not recommended for sync. DEVICE_TIME\tAccurate device capture time. All sensors on the same Aria device share this domain.\tRecommended for single-device data. HOST_TIME\tArrival time in the host computer's domain. May not be accurate.\tDebugging, host-side analysis. TIME_CODE\t[Aria-Gen1 only] TimeSync server's domain using external time-code devices, accurate across devices in multi-device capture.\tMulti-device synchronization. TIC_SYNC\t[Aria-Gen1 only] TimeSync server's domain using tic-sync, accurate for multi-device capture.\tMulti-device synchronization. SubGhz\t[Aria-Gen2 only] TimeSync server's domain using SubGhz signals, accurate for multi-device capture.\tMulti-device synchronization. Utc\tUTC time domain, only seconds-level accuracy.\tCoarse, global time reference.  TimeQueryOptions​  Name\tDescriptionBefore\tReturns the last valid data with timestamp &lt;= t_query. After\tReturns the first valid data with timestamp &gt;= t_query. Closest\tReturns the data sample closest to t_query. If two are equally close, returns the one before the query.

Please refer to the multi-device recording wiki page from ARK (TODO: add link) to learn how to record with this feature.

It is essentially a timestamp hash mapping from host DEVICE_TIME -&gt; client DEVICE_TIME. Therefore this mapping data stream only exists in client VRS, but not host VRS.

Currently supported on-device MP algorithms include Eye-tracking, Hand-tracking, and VIO. These algorithm results are stored as separate data streams in the VRS file.  VIO (Visual Inertial Odometry) combines camera images and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) data to estimate device pose and motion in real-time. VIO tracks the device's position, orientation, and velocity by performing visual tracking, IMU integration, sensor fusion, etc, making it the foundation for spatial tracking and understanding.  In Aria-Gen2 devices, the VIO algorithm are run on device to produce 2 types of tracking results as part of the VRS file: VIO and VIO High Frequency. This tutorial focuses on demonstration of how to use the on-device VIO and VIO_high_frequency results.  What you'll learn:  How to access on-device VIO and VIO_high_frequency data from VRS filesHow to visualize 3D trajectory from on-device VIO data.

Devices are fabricated according to the design, but with errors. A device's factory calibration is a one-time measurement of the position of each component in the device, with the goal that:  Calibration error MUCH SMALLER THAN CAD error  Otherwise there's no point doing calibration. This leads to our recommendation that, every time you use a CAD model with real data, consider why you don't want to take advantage of the reduced error in factory calibration.

CPF, defined as the middle-interpolation of the two nominal pupil frames, therefore, also only lives in the CAD model. However, these entities are not observable during Aria calibration.  Now, if we need to report T_CPF_sensor(calibration), this pose is a transform from the CAD model space to the calibration model space. The two model spaces are independent (just like two Aria units), and there's no standard convention on how this alignment should be done. Therefore this pose is mathematically undefined.  In projectaria-tools, we choose to align Aria's CAD and device calibration according to the device frame (as shown in Figure 2), therefore:  T_frame1(CAD)_frame2(calibration) = T_frame1(CAD)_device(CAD) * T_device(calibration)_frame2(calibration)   We often call this &quot;anchoring frame1 and frame2 to the device frame&quot;.  And T_CPF_sensor depends on the device frame:  T_CPF_sensor(calibration) = T_CPF_device(CAD) * T_device_sensor(calibration)   ()  Figure 2.

This means, if you would like to use a T_CPF_sensor with a sensor frame in the calibration space, you really need to be aware of what CPF means here, and it is generally a proxy of the device frame. A better choice would be staying away from CPF-based pose conventions. Rather we recommend using pose among sensor frames to be able to safely switch between CAD space and calibration space.

The outputs are then saved to your local directory. The MPS CLI will try to process multiple recordings concurrently. The concurrency for various stages can be controlled via Settings.    Once you submit your request, the MPS CLI for the selected mode will open and show the status of your requests. See the Getting Started or the Command Line Reference below for how to submit a request. Once authenticated, the request tool checks with the server to see if this recording was previously processed. We use unique IDs (Hashing stage) to check if this is a new or a previously known recording.If it is a known recording, we skip processing and directly download the results (Download Results stage) or show the error code.If this is a new recording, we run health checks on the recording (HealthCheck stage), to minimize the chances that it will fail during processing. While this check catches obvious errors, like gaps in data and ensures presence of the right sensor streams, but server side processing may still fail.If the health check passes, the recording is encrypted on your machine (Encrypting stage).After encryption, the recordings are uploaded to the MPS servers (Uploading stage) for processing. Uploads are resumable.Interrupted uploads can be resumed within 24 hours. Data is processed on MPS servers (Processing stage). The MPS CLI periodically checks the MPS request's status on the server.It is safe to close the MPS Request tool once the data is processing. When the MPS CLI is reopened, it will check the status of your data and progress to Downloading if it is ready.  If you get an error code The server re-attempts processing multiple times before it stops and provides an error message Check Error Codes to see what the error was. In the MPS CLI, you can click (Cmd + click on Mac, Ctrl + click on Linux) on the error code to reach the troubleshooting page.We encourage you to send a bug report with log files to Aria User Support if it is not an error code 1xx. By default, logs are stored in /tmp/logs/projectaria/mps/.
