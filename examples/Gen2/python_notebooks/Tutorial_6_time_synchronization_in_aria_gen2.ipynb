    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In Project Aria glasses, one of the key features is that it provides multi-sensor data that are **temporally aligned** to a shared, device-time domain for each single device, and also provide **multi-device temporal synchronization** using SubGHz signals (Aria Gen2), TICSync (Aria Gen1), or TimeCode signals (Aria Gen1). In this tutorial, we will demonstrate how to use such temporal aligned data from Aria Gen2 recordings.\n",

    "In `projectaria_tools`, every timestamp is linked to a specific `TimeDomain`, which represents the time reference or clock used to generate that timestamp. Timestamps from different `TimeDomain`s are not directly comparable—only timestamps within the same `TimeDomain` are consistent and can be accurately compared or aligned.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Supported Time Domains\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Important: Use `DEVICE_TIME` for single-device Aria data analysis**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "| Time Domain | Description | Usage |\n",
    "|-------------|-------------|-------|\n",
    "| **DEVICE_TIME (Recommended)**| Capture time in device's time domain. Accurate and reliable. All sensors on the same Aria device share the same device time domain. | **Use this for single-device Aria data analysis** |\n",
    "| **RECORD_TIME** | Timestamps stored in the index of VRS files. For Aria glasses, these are equal to device timestamp converted to double-precision floating point. | Fast access, but use DEVICE_TIME for accuracy |\n",
    "| **HOST_TIME** | Timestamps when sensor data is saved to the device (not when captured). | Should not be needed for any purpose |\n",

    "- **RECORD_TIME**: Timestamps stored in VRS file index. For Aria glasses, these equal device timestamps converted to double-precision floating point, but use DEVICE_TIME directly for best accuracy.\n",

    "\n",
    "### Data API to query by timestamp\n",
    "The VRS data provider offers powerful timestamp-based data access through the `get_$SENSOR_data_by_time_ns()` API family. This is the recommended approach for temporal alignment across sensors and precise timestamp-based data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any sensor type, you can query data by timestamp using the `get_$SENSOR_data_by_time_ns()` function, where `$SENSOR` can be replaced by any sensor data type available in Aria VRS. See the [VrsDataProvider.h](link-to-code) for a complete list of supported sensor types.\n",

    "## Multi-Device Timestamp alignment\n",
    "While recording, multiple Aria-Gen2 glasses can enable a feature that allows their timestamps to be mapped across devices using SubGHz signals. Please refer to the multi-device recording wiki page from ARK (TODO: add link) to learn how to record with this feature. \n",
    "\n",
    "Basically, one pair of glasses acts as the **host** device, that actively broadcasts SubGHz signals to a specified channel; \n",
    "all other glasses act as **client** devices, that receives the SubGHz signals, and record a new `Time Domain Mapping` data streams in their VRS file.  \n",
    "It is essentially a timestamp hash mapping from **host** `DEVICE_TIME` -> **client** `DEVICE_TIME`. \n",
    "Therefore this mapping data stream **only exists in client VRS**, but not **host VRS**. \n",
    "\n",
    "In `projectaria_tools`, we provide 2 types of APIs to easily perform timestamp-based query across multi-device recordings: \n",
    "1. Converter APIs provides direct convert functions that maps timestamps between any 2 `TimeDomain`. \n",
    "2. Query APIs that allows users to specifies `time_domain = TimeDomain.SUBGHZ` in a client VRS, to query \"from timestamp of the host\".\n",
